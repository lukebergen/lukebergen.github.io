Anybody can aquire spells and learn to use them, but those who do so prodigiously are usually referred to as "magic users". Magic users are not uncommon, but those that go beyond simply using spells are referred to as scholars.
</p>

<p>
Some scholars of the language believe that the language itself is pure and unchanging and that it is actually the human mind that constantly shifts and changes.
</p>

<p>
Some of these scholars make the decision to devote their lives to immersing themselves in the language in an attempt to realign their minds to the patterns of the language. The more success they have, the more inhuman they seem to become.
</p>

<p>
Thus, in theory, the most powerful wizard in the world would be one who could speak True Language easily on command. Never forgetting words and phrases and having to expend no mental effort to bend the world to their will. But this person would be so inhuman in their mental patterns that they probably couldn't communicate anymore and their patterns of logic and reasoning would look to normal humans like complete incoherence.
