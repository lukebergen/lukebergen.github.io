<p>
There are some number of Gods who speak amongst themselves. Their speach is what causes the universe to be and to change over time.
</p>

<p>
Not much is known of them other than that there are multiple of them. It's theorized that the goings on in the world reflect the nature of the interactions of the Gods. For example, a chaotic storm followed by a beautiful spring day might be the result of a violent dispute followed by a reconciliation.
</p>

<p>
Some pray to the Gods but so far as anyone can tell, they don't seem to be interested or even aware of their impact on their creation.
