<p>
The god <a href="Valsi.html">Valsi</a> is a linguist. His study of Truelang translates into a knowledge and observation of the universe. As a result, he's the only god to have an awareness of the goings on of the universe as events in and of themselves. When he noticed that some of the patterns seemed to communicate with one another using something like language, he became curious and created the dictionary books to see if humans could learn to use Truelang via the binding words.
