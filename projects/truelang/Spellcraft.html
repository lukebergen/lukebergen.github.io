Scholars bind markings on paper to references to the True Words that nobody knows and whose representation takes the form of sounds and noises.
</p>

<p>
This is how they do that...
</p>

<p>
As best as the scholars can tell, there are 3 categories of words as it pertains to True Language.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
True Words (the actual language as spoken by the gods. Incomprehensible to human. No human will ever hear, understand, or know these)

<li>
Binding Words (very little is understood about these. Only the most advanced magic users are able to use them. They are used to bind True Words to paper as Speakable Words)

<li>
Speakable Words (these are what most magic users use regularly)

</ol>

<p>
As an example an extremely advanced scholar wants to write down a spell in a spell book for setting on fire the thing at which the speaker looks.
</p>

<p>
The True Words for this spell would be: fagri lo teljundi. No human anywhere will ever see, hear, or know these sounds. It is just beyond a human mind to contain these words.
</p>

<p>
The scholar holds in mind the mental image of a person focusing on an object and that object erupting in flame. Focusing on these ideas and keeping the words for them out of mind, focusing only on the concepts, speaking the binding words, and moving the pen however feels natural, Speakable Words form on the page.
</p>

<p>
If done correctly, a few things happen.
</p>

<p>
The binding words are lost and cannot be re-used.
</p>

<p>
The writing on the paper is forever linked to the True Words for the concept that the scholar had in mind. Over time, the shapes of the letters will change such that the Speakable Words always reference and act as stand-ins for the True Words that they represent.
</p>

<p>
Now a magic user finds this piece of paper (and the scholar was helpful enough to write down in common english what this particular spell does).
The magic user expends the mental effort to reveal (understand) the Speakable Words. Let's say that today they're represented as "kax folthrane".
With the words understood, the magic user can focus on the same concept as the spell creator and speak the words, and flame will erupt from whatever object he is focusing on.
Speaking the words causes them to shift and he must re-expend the mental energy necessary to learn the spell's new Speakable Words.
