      Note from years later. I originally did this thing way back in the mid 2010s at some point. I made it <em>well</em> before the LLM/GenAI hype train. It uses (badly) a genetic algorithm and doesn't do any LLM stuff or hit an API to kick off a process on a graphics card somewhere. Just some really poorly optimized JS running in browser for messing around with an idea. And with that caveat out of the way...
