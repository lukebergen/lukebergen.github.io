<p>
Apologies in advance. I've tried to keep all the <a href="philosophy.html">philosophy</a> stuff in its own little section of this wiki. But this topic <em>reeeally</em> pulls me towards that stuff. I'll try to be diligent about keeping things practical.
</p>

<p>
There are 16 words that all follow a common pattern. They're the two letter words that start with a consonant and end in "y". So <code>py</code>, <code>by</code>, <code>ky</code>, etc... These are the "reference" words. The definitions for these are
</p>

<pre>
py = the "p" reference
by = the "b" reference
etc...
</pre>

<p>
That's not especially helpful. Hence this entire page to talk about what it means for something to be "the 'p' reference".
</p>

<p>
<code>ny</code> is a special case so we'll set it aside for now while we address the other 15.
</p>

<p>
Reference words are most similar to pronouns of other languages but are a little different in some interesting ways.
</p>

<p>
Unused, reference words refer to anything/everything that can be expressed. They take on meaning in a conversation by how they're used. Let me use <code>dy</code> in an example conversation to show you what I mean. But first, real quick...
</p>

<pre>
co x = $x but decorated with the meta-information that the speaker wants to know more about it (e.g. `co kleso do ti` =&gt; "do you like it?", "how do you like it?", etc...)
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
Alice: Let's have <code>co dy</code> for dinner (what do you want to do for dinner (we'll use <code>dy</code> to refer to whatever it is))

<li>
Bob: <code>dy</code> isn't pizza. We just had that

<li>
Alice: Agreed. <code>dy</code> isn't too heavy. I'm not super hungry

<li>
Bob: could <code>dy</code> be sushi?

<li>
Alice: <code>dy</code> is sushi or maybe tacos.

<li>
Bob: Ooo tacos. <code>dy</code> is definitely tacos.

</ul>
<p>
Think of <code>dy</code> in this conversation as a circle in a Venn diagram. Before being used at all, it's a circle that encompasses the entire diagram. When Alice uses it in the first sentence, the circle narrow significantly down to only those things that would make sense in the sentence "Let's have &lt;it&gt; for dinner". The circle gets narrower and narrower before finally becoming the relatively small circle "tacos". Though, note: <code>dy</code> is still a circle here. It can continue being narrowed infinitely finer and finer and will never become a singular point (aaaahh stop. Leave it for <a href="philosophy.html">philosophy</a>).
</p>

<p>
Generally, the more a reference gets used throughout a conversation, the narrower it's possible meaning becomes. The fact that we have so many of these references and that they start with each of the 16 consonants allows for some fun uses. A couple quick definitions...
</p>

<pre>
te x = 0 $x
ca x = 1 $x
go x = 2 $x
bu x = 3 $x
vi x = 4 $x
je x = 5 $x
ra x = 6 $x
mo x = 7 $x
su x = 8 $x
di x = 9 $x
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
Alice: you want <code>co cy</code> sugars in your coffee (how many sugars do you want (we'll call the number <code>cy</code>))

<li>
Bob: <em>sigh</em>. <code>ca</code> sugar

</ul>
<p>
Bob can reply with any number he wants. But by selecting the <code>cy</code> reference word to ask Bob which number he'd like, Alice lightly hints that maybe a "c" number word might be what Bob is looking for. Another example.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Alice: I saw Paul and Greg at the store earlier

<li>
Bob: Are they together?

<li>
Alice: nah, <code>py</code> is seeing <code>ty</code> remember?

<li>
Bob: <code>co ty</code>?

<li>
Alice: <code>ty</code> is Tim

</ul>
<p>
This leads to another helpful set of words. For each of the reference words, there's also a word that ends with "i". So <code>pyi</code>, <code>byi</code>, <code>cyi</code>, etc... 
</p>

<pre>
pyi x = "py" is $x. $x
byi x = "by" is $x. $x
etc...
</pre>

<p>
<code>pyi</code> works exactly the same way that <code>py</code> does except that it takes in a single value and starts the <code>py</code> reference off as starting with "and it starts with that". So our earlier example talking about dinner could have been started with
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Alice: let's eat <code>co dyi</code> dinner

</ul>
<p>
All Englishized like this it might not seem as clear where this would be useful, but in pure Nest, it can be a handy shortcut.
</p>

<p>
Ok, we've put it off long enough. <code>ny</code>. In Nest, if a word requires 3 values, then 3 values it must have. A sentence that only gives 2 values to a 3-value word is ungrammatical and would leave a listener waiting / expecting more to come.
</p>

<p>
But what if I don't want/need to specify one of the arguments?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Alice: would you like to make a donation?

<li>
Bob: <code>sonda mi ny ny</code> (here we're trying to say "I already gave". The how much and the who-to are irrelevant or discernible from context)

</ul>
<p>
So <code>ny</code> can be thought of as "grammatically I'm forced to say something here, but I wish I could leave it blank". Dipping dangerously close to <a href="philosophy.html">philosophy</a>, in our Venn diagram analogy from earlier, <code>ny</code> represents a special circle that always encompasses the entire diagram and can never be narrowed further. This way, it always represents "anything could be said here and be a legitimate interpretation".
</p>

<p>
So <em>technically</em>, Bob would be telling the truth even if he had given nothing since "0" is a legitimate value that <code>ny</code> could represent. But in practice, that'd be a dick move and nobody would assume that's what was meant. That might sound hand-wavey. And it is. But we <em>do</em> do this hand-waviness thoughtfully. We'll talk more about this "you know what I mean" type stuff in <a href="context.html">context</a> where these reference words feature heavily.
