<p>
Nest has 6 vowels and 16 consonants. They and their sounds are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
e (bet)

<li>
a (father)

<li>
o (boat)

<li>
u (flute)

<li>
i (see)

<li>
y (sun)

<li>
p (pop)

<li>
b (bob)

<li>
k (cat)

<li>
g (go)

<li>
t (top)

<li>
d (do)

<li>
f (fun)

<li>
v (victory)

<li>
s (sun)

<li>
z (zebra)

<li>
c (she)

<li>
j (seizure)

<li>
r (run)

<li>
l (leg)

<li>
m (me)

<li>
n (no)

</ul>
<p>
Notice that these mostly follow english with a few exceptions. The vowels in English play so much double-duty that I don't think any consistent and useful phonology would be able to be "basically English" and also consistent.
</p>

<p>
The consonants are much closer and have only a couple of exceptions. "c" says "sh" as in "show". "j" sounds like the "z" of seizure or the "g" of beige.
</p>

<p>
There are some diphthongs as well. Most will be familiar to english speakers like "bl" as in "blink" or "kr" as in "cream". Two that might seem off but which <em>do</em> follow naturally are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
tc: sounds like "ch" as in "check"

<li>
dj: sounds like many instances of "j" as in "jump"

</ul>
<p>
These might seem off. But have a bit of fun trying to say the "t" sound followed by "sh". Progressively smushing the sounds together and see that it does start sound like the "ch" of "check". Same with "dj".
</p>

<p>
Many vowle diphthongs
</p>

<ul>
<li>
ei sounds like the vowel in "hey"

<li>
ai sounds like the "y" in "fly"

<li>
oi sounds like "oy" (as in "toy")

<li>
yi sounds like the "i" bite

</ul>
<p>
The "yi" one can be especially tricky for some folks. Note the difference in sound between "i" in "bite" vs the "i" in "high". "high" =&gt; "ai". "bite" =&gt; "yi". Think of "yi" as "uh - ee" smushed together.
</p>

<p>
There are technically other possible vowel combinations that could create other diphthongs. But for now, these are the ones that exist in actual usage. Others may come up in future.
