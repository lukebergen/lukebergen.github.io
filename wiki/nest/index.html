It's ironic that I struggle to put in place a structure for how to describe this language that exists in my head. A series of disconnected thoughts with "oh, but put that aside, that's a whole different topic" references pointing to other thoughts?
</p>

<p>
I tried a book. A spreadsheet. A blog. Now I'm trying a wiki. This is the intro page where I give some high-level introductory information about what this thing even is, and then link off to the real meat of the thing.
</p>

<p>
Ok so what the heck am I even talking about? Nest. Nest (or natively: <code>fu tceni</code>, is a conlang created/discovered by some guy who likes thinking about things.
</p>

<p>
There's a whole lot of <a href="why.html">why</a>. But that's for a different page. At a high level, Nest is a language like English or Mandarin. But unlike those languages, this one was created/designed rather than evolving naturally. That gives it some advantages and also some disadvantages.
</p>

<p>
Enough rambling. As I said, I've tried to get this language out of my head and into the world a bunch of times in different formats and it somehow never gets all the way there. So trying this wiki thing and we'll see where it goes. Maybe just putting some structure to the cloud of thoughts will make it easier to take a step-2 where I organize things into a more linear thing like a book or something. Anyway, here goes.
</p>

<p>
Here's some top level topics to get started. Most any page on this wiki should be one or two links away from one of these.
