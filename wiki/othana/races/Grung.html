They are a fairly religious people whose central dogma comes from the words spoken by their god "purge the corruption". The vast majority of the Grung interpret this in a hostile, xenophobic way. Fortunately for the rest of the inhabitants of Othana, the Grung are not much for exploration and mostly aim to keep their own island clean of "corruption" rather than trying to "purge" it from other islands or the world as a whole.
