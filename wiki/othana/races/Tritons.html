<ul>
<li>
Children's creation myth

<ul>
<li>
The Tritons were once mindless creatures wandering the sea

<li>
One day the land dwellers became a thing and god-of-sea summoned the Tritons to the region to protect the land dwellers

<li>
God-of-sea gave them intelligence, strength, etc... to help them protect the weak land dwellers

<li>
This is why the Tritons have a general sense of superiority/haughtiness

<li>
As a result, the Tritons see it as their duty to patrol the sea watching for landers in distress

<ul>
<li>
ship wrecks, hostile sea creatures, etc...

</ul>
<li>
Tritons have a racial trait where when in close proximity to ancient technology, they feel unease

<ul>
<li>
The more powerful the tech/close to it they come, the greater the unease

<li>
Similar to a spider sense but more unpleasant and fear-oriented

<ul>
<li>
For those Tritons who mingle with landers, this creates a dissonance

<li>
On the one hand, they (landers) are weak and in need of protection. But on the other hand they also blithely wander into and even <em>use</em> ancient tech

</ul>
