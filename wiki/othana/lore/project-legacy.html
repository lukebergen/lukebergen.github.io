<p>
This is the general project defined by the ancients to attempt to ensure that sentient life would continue in some form or another on whatever the planet might look like once it'd returned to some kind of equilibrium.
</p>

It takes many different forms depending on the base of operation interpreting it.
</p>

<p>
Some groups decided to aim for a true organic life form that would be hardy enough to live in the new world.
Others aimed for mechanical successors.
Others tried to find a way to continue on in their present state (trying to weather the climate and hoping that the planet would end up habitable once it hit equilibrium).
Ephasus was one such station. And while they forgot their original purpose in the millenia spent beneath the surface, they did end up surviving to repopulate the world
