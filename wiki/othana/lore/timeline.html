<pre><code>      0 BW/AW, ~2500 BE        ~2500 AW, 0 BE/AE           2361 AE, 0BC/AC   ????</code></pre>
<p>The bulk of the wiki at this point is centered around the “modern
day” i.e. “After Emergence”/“Before Chaos”.</p>
<p>To modern people, history begins (in theory) at 0 AE. While anything
prior to 0 AE is regarded as myth, in reality, the first 3 or 4
centuries AE are equally murky. So generally the initials aren’t even
used, people just refer to the current year as being 2361.</p>
<h2 id="before-weapon">Before Weapon</h2>
<p>Othana is a continent peopled by two major nations. Eshiam and its
elves in the south west and Ufreau and its dwarves in the north east.
Humans are a wandering race that freely move about the continent.</p>
<p>The two nations go through periods of war and peace.</p>
<p>During a millenia long peace, the discovery of 6 forms of magical
energy are discovered. With the discovery of magical energy, technology
and innovation develop rapidly.</p>
<p>Something happens. A perceived sleight between the nations at a time
when both were ruled by petty kings leads to an escalating conflict that
lasts several years.</p>
<p>0 AW/~-2500 BE The conflict climaxes when the one side use a weapon
of such power that the war ends immediately.</p>
<h2 id="after-weapon-before-emergence">After Weapon / Before
Emergence</h2>
<p>Both sides of the conflict quickly realize that the use of this
weapon has had unexpected, immeasurable, and global impact.</p>
<p>Where before, magic (the Aether) was thin and timid. Now it is thick
and turbulent. The results on the environment are catastrophic.</p>
<p>Oceans begin to rise. The seasons become more intense and difficult.
Species begin evolving and adapting. Others go extinct.</p>
<p>As the oceans continue to rise, the people of Othana begin scrambling
to undo the damage. Refractor technology is developed to absorb,
contain, and control the aether permeating everything. But by the time
this new technology is put to use, it is too late. Estimates predict
that within 500 years, the entire continent will be covered in
water.</p>
<p>Experts disagree on what will happen after. Some predict a
never-ending sea rise. Most expect the sea to begin receding, though no
consensus is ever found as to how far the recession will go. Will Othana
remain forever underwater or will the continent ever break the surface
again?</p>
<p><a href="/othana/lore/project-legacy">project legacy</a> is developed
with the goal of finding or creating a way to ensure that sentient life
will persist in whatever the world might look like in the future.</p>
<p>Myriad projects begin across the continent, merging or dying off as
ecological disaster and loss of land forces teams to abandon their
projects or merge with others as teams consolidate to the mountains
(becoming islands over the decades).</p>
<p>Some teams attempt to find organic solutions to the problem of life
in the new world. Others work toward intelligent mechanical constructs.
Some hedge their bets trying to fashion life that can adapt to any
possible environment. Others take more pessimistic views and focus their
efforts toward creating life that’s more amenable to a landless
planet.</p>
<p>One by one, the water overtakes the last remaining islands, the
peoples of each going underground to continue their varied projects.</p>
<p>Roughly 500AW/2000BE the last of the land sinks beneath the sea.</p>
<p>During this time, the different teams use the power of green magical
energy to remain in contact with one another. They share some
breakthroughs, withhold others. Among the techniques shared between the
groups are reaver technologies (the creation of both organic and
mechanical life of varied intelligence).</p>
<p>Between 500AW/2000BE and 1500AW/1000BE all of the project’s
initiatives go dark. Either the people running them die off, or, their
maintainers decide that trying to build life on a still fluctuating
planet is futile. Those that are able to, go into a kind of hibernation
waiting for the planet to return to a homeostasis in which they can
again begin the effort of building life that the planet will be able to
sustain.</p>
<p>It is during this time of hibernation that an accident causes one
underwater research lab to explode. The site became a kind of magically
polluted death zone. However, a humanoid-like race of beasts found
themselves attracted to the magical pollution. It’s effects causing
rapid evolution. The Tritons begin to develop.</p>
<p>Roughly 1200AW/1300BE the waters begin to recede.</p>
<p>1300AW/1200BE the evolution of the Tritons has hit a point of maximal
effect. Continued time spent near magic begins to have counterproductive
effects on their evolution. They begin to feel repelled by the
pollution.</p>
<p>Around 2100AW/400BE Abimelech performs a ritual establishing the four
barriers surrounding the region and helping mitigate some of the effects
of the thicker aether. Coupled with the refractors doing their work, the
ecosystem begins to stabilize.</p>
<p>Roughly 2000AW/500BE land first reappears</p>
<p>Roughly 2500AW/0AE the first of a small handful of people living
underground begin to emerge and start trying to making a life for
themselves above ground, setting out to explore the world.</p>
<h2 id="after-emergence">After Emergence</h2>
<p>Not much is recorded in the first few centuries after the emergence.
Exploration lead to groups living on several of the islands remaining
above the sea. It’s unclear to history which island the first people
came from.</p>
<p>Around 800AE the water levels stop receding. The planet has begun to
reach a homeostasis. The water level stabalizes, seasons become more
stable and predictable, intense storms become less frequent/intense,
etc…</p>
<p>Around 1000AE unbeknownst to most of the peoples living on land, the
first of some of <a href="/othana/lore/project-legacy">project
legacy</a>’s efforts begin activating across many of the islands.</p>
<p>Around 1600AE Tortles begin to appear.</p>
<p>Around 1800AE The first of the Genasi appear.</p>
<p>2147AE Delilah Sunderveldt is born on fishing island of Galatia</p>
<p>2157AE Delilah Sunderveldt, 10, sees some rudimentary scrap and
begins experimenting</p>
<p>2161AE Delilah publishes a book with the results of all her
experimentation</p>
<p>2162AE Delilah first begins teaching others who travel to learn from
her. This marks the beginning of the University of Galtia</p>
<p>2179AE A technique to open the major gates is discovered and the
diggers guild and licensing system is founded.</p>
<p>2330AE Purgumum is destroyed in a flash of light so brilliant, it can
be seen from Sardis.</p>
<p>2331AE Dragons, attracted to whatever destroyed Purgumum first settle
there.</p>
<p>2332AE Something spooks the dragons and they leave.</p>
<p>The period of time that the dragons were on Purgumum is short enough
that in present day, they are considered a myth But also, given the
tales of the destructive light and horrible monsters, nobody goes near
Pergamum.</p>
<p>2361AE The first Dragonborn emerges on Pergamum.</p>
<p>The current year is 2361. The last 200 years have been a time of
general peace, growth, and prosperity (isolated incidents here and there
notwithstanding). As a result, magic and technology are on the rise.
Depending on how the events of the campaign go, the era may end with the
campaign in 2361AE leading into the Chaos Era. Or, the players may side
with <a href="/othana/npcs/Abimelech">Abimelech</a> which gives humanity
another 40 years before the era of chaos begins.</p>
<p>TL;DR:</p>
<ul>
<li>eras go:
<ul>

<li>733AW Enoch invents reaver technology</li>
<li>500AW-1500AW over a millennia the different islands have their own
histories. During this time, Project Legacy floundered and either paused
or was forgotten about on an island to island basis. It’s during this
time that things like language evolution and such occur. This is the
period of time when “the ancients” transformed into “modern people”</li>
<li>900AW research lab accident (with Triton development beginning
shortly thereafter)</li>
<li>1200AW/1300BE the water begins to recede</li>
<li>1300AW/1200BE tritons largely “finished” developing</li>
<li>2000AW/500BE land first reappears</li>
<li>2100AW/400BE Abilmelech establishes the four barriers surrounding
Othana to try to help stabilize the regions aether levels</li>
<li>2500AW/0AE a small handful of people emerge from one of the island
ruins</li>
<li>800AE water levels stop receding</li>
<li>900AE estimated date of oldest reputable book of history</li>
<li>1000AE many islands that had paused project legacy while the
planet’s weather systems normalized now re-activate.</li>
<li>1600AE the first of the Tortles appear</li>
<li>1800AE the first of the Genasi appear</li>
<li>2100AE magic and refractors are first re-discovered. Though their
usage is very rudimentary</li>
<li>2265AE refractors/magic/tech starts picking up (Galtia University
begins taking off)</li>
<li>2280AE with the discovery of how to open the major gates, the
diggers guild and licensing system is established</li>
<li>2330AE destruction of Pergamum</li>
<li>2331AE unbeknownst to most, dragons settle on Pergamum</li>
<li>2332AE dragons leave Pergamum</li>
<li>2361AE the first Dragonborn emerges on Pergamum</li>
<li>2361AE today</li>
<li>2361AE OR (depending on player actions) 2401AE the 4 barriers come
down and the aether of Othana thickens and becomes turbulent again</li>
</ul>
