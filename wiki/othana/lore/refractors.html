<p>
<span class="todo">TODO</span>: there's gotta be more than just these 6 forms. Consider damage types as well (radiant?)
</p>

<p>
While magic is everywhere and in everything, refractors act as a kind of natural magnet/retainer of this magic power. As a result, refractors are often used to power magical artifacts. Additionally, their raw energy can be tapped into for mechanical devices as well.
</p>

<p>
colors = "forms"
</p>

<p>
They come in several sizes, colors, and grades. Sizes are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64 centimeters (the extremes are more rare). Colors are: red, blue, green, orange, yellow, clouded. Grades are rated from 1 to 5.
</p>

<p>
The grade of a refractor can be thought of as it's general quality. People who work with refactors a lot (arcana check) can usually tell the grade of a refractor by examination. Generally the more finely cut, the higher the grade. So a grad-1 refractor basically looks like an elongated D10 while a grade-5 would look like an extremely intricate gem. The cuts of a refractor are always vertically symetric as most machines activate them via revolution so balance along an axis is important.
</p>

<p>
Color is more complicated than size or grade. The color of a refractor determines the type of magical energy it tends to attract and harness.
</p>

<p>
Most refractors simply look like colored glass, "clouded" being the only exception. Clouded refractors look like they were clear but with an everswirling smokey grayness within and on the surface. Almost as if the area around the refractor is within a smoky room and the area the refractor occupies is the only place where this smoke is visible.

<p>
From a natural-magic user's perspective:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
red: creation and manipulation of energy (evocation)

<li>
blue: instants of motion and position, conjuring (abjuration + conjuration)

<li>
green: mind, information, psychic (enchantment (as it relates to people/minds) + divination (as it relates to communication (e.g. speak with beasts)))

<li>
yellow: alteration changing things or properties of things (transmutation)

<li>
orange: perception, lacking substance yet having effect (illusion + perceptiony type divination spells)

<li>
clouded-gray: soul. life and death. Similar in some ways to green but where green is more mental, clouded is more heart. (necromancy + occasional enchantment)

<li>
mauve: binding (all things sticky). Terrain manipulation. Restriction of movement. Also often used in burdening rituals

</ol>
<p>
From a mechinist's perspective:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
red: batteries, conversion (energy)

<li>
blue: bursty by default, motion oriented, with a capacitor can be used for sustained motion

<li>
green: communication/information-oriented

<li>
yellow: Used for "burdening", conversion (material/motion)

<li>
orange: illusions, detection devices, anything to make perceiving easier (or harder)

<li>
clouded-gray: life, death, heart, "ki". Healing machines, life detection. Probably most often used in conduction with another color (necromancy)

<li>
mauve: The duct tape to blue's WD-40

</ol>

<p>
The process by which a refractor (or a mundane object) is bound to a particular function. Involves the refractor being bound (or mundane item), a yellow control refractor, and optionally additional refractors depending on the effect being bound.
This is how e.g. health potions are made.
