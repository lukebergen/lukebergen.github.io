<ul>
<li>
It had been 20 years since Pergumum was destroyed by the beam of radiant light (the sky was still scorched where the beam had pierced it)

<li>
Small merchant ship approaches the island with crew of 5 or 6, one of which (&lt;digger&gt;) is a new member that the captain is uncertain about

<li>
They're here to collect the glass and other exotic materials that exist on the island. At this point it's mostly picked clean, but &lt;captain&gt; still comes back when there's no better other options

<li>
While collecting materials, the new member points out the gate and admits that she's a digger with a license that could get them inside (this is why she came along in the first place)

<li>
Times have been rough so &lt;captain&gt; reluctantly agrees to explore it (against the law, but who's to know)

<li>
They're inside for hardly any time at all before they're captured by Dragonborn (nobody has ever seen such creatures before)

<li>
They have some interaction/conversation during which &lt;digger&gt; plants the seeds of the idea of leaving this ruin (their whole world up till this point) for the larger world outside

<li>
The scurrying sound approaches which sends the Dragonborn running

<li>
The crew escapes their bonds using magic and decides to run as well

<li>
Being unfamiliar with this ruin, they end up in a chamber deeper in where they find a horrifying scene of a captured dragon

<li>
A conversation later with random bits of lore, they decide to free the dragon who makes its escape

<li>
???? (is &lt;digger&gt; a Genasi? Uses their core refractor to escape?)

<li>
Crew narrowly escapes catching a brief glimse of the scurrying hive that lives deeper in the ruin

<li>
Some weeks later, a Dragonborn show up at Ephesus announcing that Pergamum is peopled again and would like to trade
