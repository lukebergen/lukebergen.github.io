Like sleeping. Yeah. It’s that kind of there-but-not. It’s a good analogy. Not perfect, but close enough. I’m asleep. Shhh. Don’t wake me. Ughh, and I’m “awake” now I guess.
</p>

<p>
That familiar steady buzz re-asserts itself. I only get to enjoy some peace when “sleeping”. Oh well. Another day another currency... unit of? Or system? Haha. Who knows. Anyway, there’s profit to be had.
</p>

<p>
Monty takes in the buzzing in his head like taking in a complex tapestry. Sipping at a cup of coffee that isn’t there but once was in some other time and place, he notices a fun little pattern in the buzz and dives in. Focusing his awareness on this particular block of static, it starts to take shape. The randomness begins to form patterns and almost without realizing it, the fuzz begins to remind Monty of the idea of senses. The smell of salt on the air. Waves are such a relaxing sound. Panic in the.... vibe-space? Ehhh, we never really did have a good word for that one. In any case, I’m on a boat now I guess. Oh! There it is. A sense of self comes back to me. I’m me. Monty, the Honest Merchant. HAHAHAH. Hello travelers in this cosmic soup of “uh-oh”. I’ve got coin if you’ve got... no that’s not it. What have you? I have.... ugh. Sorry. Not a morning person. HI! It is I! Monty, the Honest Merchant. I have wares for all your needs. Is there anything I can help you with?
</p>

<p>
The people on the ship look a bit lost. I search my has-happened-before-analogy-space and realize I have no interactions with these ones’ prior experiences. Oh. They don’t know me yet. Which, I did <em>just</em> introduce myself. So, rude. But still, it can be difficult being so one-dimensional so we make allowances for lesser beings (that’s rude Monty. Don’t be rude. Differently ___-er beings).
</p>

<p>
“I see that we have not met! I am called Monty, the Honest Merchant. Can I interest you in any of my wares?” I say this because it sets them at ease. They understand haggling and trading goods and services. I think this works for me. It’s a bit muddled to be honest.. oh no. They’re still confused. Show them the...
</p>

<p>
“I have many items for purchase if you so desire. Fishing line, bubble bath, a fine collection of oranges...” The buzz returns in something somewhat like memory. “Or perhaps materials to repair a ship.. Lumber? Nails? I have these as well. For extremely reasonable prices, no less.”
</p>

<p>
I’m supposed to act greedy now. Aquire as much valuable goods out of this as possible while giving up as little as possible. That’s two possibles in one sentence which is usually a hint. If it’s possible here and possible there, then together it should be a together kind of possible. But that’s assuming possible’s can be combined together like that. I think... they’re looking at me funny again. Save that for later. “AAAAAAAAAAAAnywhooooo. I have many wares available at incredibly reasonable prices. That’s why they call me Monty, the Honest Merchant.”
</p>

<p>
I show them an assortment of lumber, nails, etc... Plenty to help them repair their ship and make it to wherever it is that they’re going. No doubt somewhere important to do something that is also important. Importance of imports. “import”. “portent”. There’s a deepness there. Or a joke possibly.
</p>

<p>
There I go letting my head drift away without me. Anyway here is some excellent lumbar at a very reasonable price. The ship-dwellers thank me profusely and definitely aren’t suspicious of my unusual appearance or experience. (wait. Surely they can’t know of my experience. Only I have that yes?) Monty looks up, down, a dozen other directions before settling down. “Yes. I’m ok. This is ok.”
</p>

<p>
The buzzing slowly returns to his, our, my, we’re attention. “Is there anything else I can conduct a business with you about withhere?” I ask, hoping that our doing has been done. They seem grumpy about a bargain well-struck, but goods and currencies exchange hands(appendages(extensions-of-self(aquire-ers(...)))) and so we must be in good standing here.
</p>

<p>
“And so, I make my adieu.” I pull out as if zooming out. Certainly some kind of “out”ness in any case. A microscope becoming a person once more or... something like that anyway. The darkness and the staticy buzz is now all that is. I search the fabric of static that is all these bits of sentience floating in darkness. After all, Monty the Honest Merchant has the best deals for the most desperate patrons. And the louder the buzz, the better the deal.
