<p>Like sleeping. Yeah. It’s that kind of there-but-not. It’s a good
analogy. Not perfect, but close enough. I’m asleep. Shhh. Don’t wake me.
Ughh, and I’m “awake” now I guess.</p>
<p>That familiar steady buzz re-asserts itself. I only get to enjoy some
peace when “sleeping”. Oh well. Another day another currency… unit of?
Or system? Haha. Who knows. Anyway, there’s profit to be had.</p>
<p>Monty takes in the buzzing in his head like taking in a complex
tapestry. Sipping at a cup of coffee that isn’t there but once was in
some other time and place, he notices a fun little pattern in the buzz
and dives in. Focusing his awareness on this particular block of static,
it starts to take shape. The randomness begins to form patterns and
almost without realizing it, the fuzz begins to remind Monty of the idea
of senses. The smell of salt on the air. Waves are such a relaxing
sound. Panic in the…. vibe-space? Ehhh, we never really did have a good
word for that one. In any case, I’m on a boat now I guess. Oh! There it
is. A sense of self comes back to me. I’m me. Monty, the Honest
Merchant. HAHAHAH. Hello travelers in this cosmic soup of “uh-oh”. I’ve
got coin if you’ve got… no that’s not it. What have you? I have... ugh.
Sorry. Not a morning person. HI! It is I! Monty, the Honest Merchant. I
have wares for all your needs. Is there anything I can help you
with?</p>
<p>The people on the ship look a bit lost. I search my
has-happened-before-analogy-space and realize I have no interactions
with these ones’ prior experiences. Oh. They don’t know me yet. Which, I
did <em>just</em> introduce myself. So, rude. But still, it can be
difficult being so one-dimensional so we make allowances for lesser
beings (that’s rude Monty. Don’t be rude. Differently ___-er
beings).</p>
<p>“I see that we have not met! I am called Monty, the Honest Merchant.
Can I interest you in any of my wares?” I say this because it sets them
at ease. They understand haggling and trading goods and services. I
think this works for me. It’s a bit muddled to be honest.. oh no.
They’re still confused. Show them the…</p>
<p>“I have many items for purchase if you so desire. Fishing line,
bubble bath, a fine collection of oranges…” The buzz returns in
something somewhat like memory. “Or perhaps materials to repair a ship..
Lumber? Nails? I have these as well. For extremely reasonable prices, no
less.”</p>
<p>I’m supposed to act greedy now. Aquire as much valuable goods out of
this as possible while giving up as little as possible. That’s two
possibles in one sentence which is usually a hint. If it’s possible here
and possible there, then together it should be a together kind of
possible. But that’s assuming possible’s can be combined together like
that. I think… they’re looking at me funny again. Save that for later.
“AAAAAAAAAAAAnywhooooo. I have many wares available at incredibly
reasonable prices. That’s why they call me Monty, the Honest
Merchant.”</p>
<p>I show them an assortment of lumber, nails, etc… Plenty to help them
repair their ship and make it to wherever it is that they’re going. No
doubt somewhere important to do something that is also important.
Importance of imports. “import”. “portent”. There’s a deepness there. Or
a joke possibly.</p>
<p>There I go letting my head drift away without me. Anyway here is some
excellent lumbar at a very reasonable price. The ship-dwellers thank me
profusely and definitely aren’t suspicious of my unusual appearance or
experience. (wait. Surely they can’t know of my experience. Only I have
that yes?) Monty looks up, down, a dozen other directions before
settling down. “Yes. I’m ok. This is ok.”</p>
<p>The buzzing slowly returns to his, our, my, we’re attention. “Is
there anything else I can conduct a business with you about withhere?” I
ask, hoping that our doing has been done. They seem grumpy about a
bargain well-struck, but goods and currencies exchange
hands(appendages(extensions-of-self(aquire-ers(…)))) and so we must be
in good standing here.</p>
<p>“And so, I make my adieu.” I pull out as if zooming out. Certainly
some kind of “out”ness in any case. A microscope becoming a person once
more or… something like that anyway. The darkness and the staticy buzz
is now all that is. I search the fabric of static that is all these bits
of sentience floating in darkness. After all, Monty the Honest Merchant
has the best deals for the most desperate patrons. And the louder the
buzz, the better the deal.</p>
