<p>
Story of the scholar on Galatia, frustrated by the stale way that the folks running things.. run things.
</p>

<p>
He wants to dive into the ruins and learn what's going on in there but they vote to keep it locked away for fear of contaminating it (really they're just afraid of messing things up. Maintain the status quo, etc...)
</p>

<p>
Below Galatia and its seemingly random dungeon is an old broken sentience that has had to adapt. It thinks at a scale of years/decades. The inner workings of its minds being reavers zipping around in what seems like random patterns.
