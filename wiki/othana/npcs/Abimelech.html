<p>
(aka <a href="Verner.html">Verner</a> Von Bluecher)
</p>

<p>
A lich like creature that lives in modern day. The BBEG(ish).
</p>

<p>
One of the program leads of <a href="../lore/project-legacy.html">/othana/lore/project-legacy</a>. He and <a href="Haman.html">Haman</a> worked together on <a href="../locations/smyrna/index.html">/othana/locations/smyrna/</a> for some time before having a violent disagreement, leading to Abimelech disabling <a href="Haman.html">Haman</a>.
</p>

<p>
Some aspect of how he became a lich causes him to take a very conservative view of things. "If nothing changes, then things can't get worse". His mind is locked into doing things as they have been done and maintaining the status quo. This is why he is so focused on finding the source of the disturbance to the <a href="../lore/firmament.html">/othana/lore/firmament</a>.
