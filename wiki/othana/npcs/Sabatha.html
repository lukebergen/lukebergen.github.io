<p>
Sabatha is one of the program leads of <a href="../lore/project-legacy.html">/othana/lore/project-legacy</a>. She refuses as many of the enhancements that other program leads take advantage of as she can. As a result, she is the most like her original self in some ways. Unfortunately, this also means that she is more suceptible to the passage of time.
</p>

<p>
A lot of her body is mechanical at this point but only in mechanical, additive ways. Her brain and much of her internal organs are original while things like additional limbs, more powerful eyes, and things like that have been grafted onto her body. She is extremely focused on searching for a solution to the ambient magic problem, convinced that the best hope for the Project is to bring the climate back to it's original state.
</p>

<p>
Because of her incredible drive and frustrations at millenia of lack of success, she does not have a great relationship with the citizens of <a href="../locations/jaffa/index.html">/othana/locations/jaffa/</a>. Sightings are extremely rare and any interactions the <a href="../races/Grung.html">/othana/races/Grung</a> have had with her have been terrifying. In these interactions, the most often thing heard amongst her mumblings and raging "must purge the corruption". The <a href="../races/Grung.html">/othana/races/Grung</a> interpret this in a xenophobic way. But of course she's referring to the chaotic nature and density of the ambient magic outside of the <a href="../lore/firmament.html">/othana/lore/firmament</a>.
