<a href="Verner.html">/othana/npcs/Verner</a> used powerful magic to alter Miriam's mind after she discovered him doing "dangerous" things in the ruins. As a result, she doesn't seem all there.

<p>
Likes to hang out in the pasture area pulling rocks up from the bottom of the general slope and stacking them up at the top of the cliff to the north.

<p>
Will jump into the sea from the cliff and go hunting fish for meals. Likes to soak up the sun on the beach afterwards.
