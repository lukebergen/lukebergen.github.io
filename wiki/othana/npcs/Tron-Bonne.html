</p>

<ul>
<li>
Personality: brash, loud, "don't take shit from nobody"

<li>
Middle of 3 siblings. They form the "Bonn Family". A notorious pirate gang and the main reason why "pirate insurance" is a thing

<ul>
<li>
Older sibling: <a href="Teisel-Bonne.html">Teisel-Bonne</a>

</ul>
<li>

</ul>
<p>
Ship battle tactics:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
She'll send taskbots to attack the players and sabotage their ship.

<li>
The bots will just try to generally tear the ship apart, however, they do have abilities...

<ul>
<li>
Shocking grasp: D20+2 =&gt; 1d8 + 2 lightning damage &amp; disable reactions

<li>
Pocket bomb: they pull a small bomb out of an astral space and throw it

<ul>
<li>
Anyone within range 10 feet of the explosion makes a DC 15 dex save or takes 1d12+2 force damage or half on a successful save

</ul>
<li>
One has a laser gun for an arm

</ul>
<li>
Oil slick: a canon-looking thing rises up out of a trap door on the ship and sprays the player ship with oil

<ul>
<li>
Ignite: she commands one of the taskbots to go ignite as much of the oil as it can

</ul>
<li>
Battering ram: a section of her ship opens up allowing a large hydraulic battering ram to smash the side of the player ship causing structural damage

<li>
Range: Rail gun: next to the helm, she has a long rifle-looking object that fire metal bolts

<ul>
<li>
D20 + 4 attack. 1d12 + 3 damage on hit

</ul>
<li>
Melee: Shocking grasp

<ul>
<li>
D20 + 4 attack. 1d8 + 4 lightning damage on hit and can't take reactions

</ul>
<li>
Get off me: At any point she can put an impenetrable force wall around herself

<li>
Desperation move: she'll activate her and her crew's sticky boots that cause them all to stick to the surface of the ship and call to the engine room to hit The Button

<ul>
<li>
Anybody on her ship other than her or her crew must make dex saves and such or fall off as the ship picks up speed as an experimental rocket sends the ship flying off ass-over-tea-kettle into the horizon

</ul>
</ul>
