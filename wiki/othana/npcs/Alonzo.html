Personality

<ul>
<li>
Like a Dr Seuesian version of Big Top (the sentient hat from Mario Party 8)

</ul>
<li>
Appearance

<ul>
<li>
A cloud of floating scrap and refractors with a badly disheveled "cat in the hat" styled hat floating jauntily above the cloud of scrap.

<li>
Despite not having visible eyes, mouth, or other facial features, the rumpled nature of the hat seems to move around in ways that gives the impression of where its attention is, when it's speaking the creases and such move as if mouth-like

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
the hole of its hat is a multi-dimensional portal that it uses to pull it's wares from and take payments

<li>
has an uncanny knack for showing up at the time when you most need some particular goods which he just so happens to have in supply.

<ul>
<li>
Out of bubble bath but already in? &lt;pop&gt; there's (weirdly) Alonzo with a premium bottle of bubble bath soap. And so affordable too.

</ul>
<li>
while his goods are fine, he absolutely charges a premium, knowing that his customers are generally in a bind.

</ul>
