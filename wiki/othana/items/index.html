<div id="Items-Uncommonish"><h2 id="Uncommonish" class="header"><a href="#Items-Uncommonish">Uncommonish</a></h2></div>

</p>

<div id="Items-Uncommonish-Magical Absorber"><h3 id="Magical Absorber" class="header"><a href="#Items-Uncommonish-Magical Absorber">Magical Absorber</a></h3></div>
<p>
<a href="../lore/refractors.html#burdening">/othana/lore/refractors#burdening</a> (blue) (ranked 1-9)
</p>

<p>
Description: A blue refractor that seems to pull ambient magical energy into itself. Visually, this looks like hard-to-discern heat-waves of light being slowly drawn into the refractor.
</p>

<p>
On reaction to a spell being cast activate this item (destroying it) to re-focus the magical energy of the spell and absorb it into a weapon of your choosing. The next attack made by this weapon will do 1d4 per spell level of magical damage. The type of damage done is dependent on the type of spell cast.
</p>

<p>
// <span class="todo">TODO</span>: map spell types to element type (or just wing it?)
</p>

<div id="Items-Uncommonish-Beam Sword"><h3 id="Beam Sword" class="header"><a href="#Items-Uncommonish-Beam Sword">Beam Sword</a></h3></div>
<p>
+1 magical weapon (magical slashing damage) (dynamic, attuned, infused)
</p>

<p>
dynamic: grows with the level of the wielder
attuned: requires attunement and takes up one of the players 3 attunement slots
infused: has additional properties/abilities based on the currently bound refractor
</p>

<p>
Description: A beam sword with a retractable metal arm that allows the sword to be deactivated and stowed as a smallish sized object when not in use.
</p>

<p>
As a bonus action you can activate or deactivate the beam.
When you use this weapon to make a melee attack, on a hit do an additional 1d4 magical damage of the type currently bound to the weapon. The amount of additional damage increases at higher levels.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, unbeknownst to the players at this point, on a critical hit additional effects occur.
</p>

<p>
// <span class="todo">TODO</span>: balance this (i.e. dear players: this is not set in stone)
progression rate:
1-5: 1d4
6-10: 2d4
11-15: 3d4
16-20: 4d4
</p>

<div id="Items-Uncommonish-Spirit Armor"><h3 id="Spirit Armor" class="header"><a href="#Items-Uncommonish-Spirit Armor">Spirit Armor</a></h3></div>
<p>
+1 magical plate armor (same restrictions as heavy plate)
</p>

<p>
This +1 magical armor can adapt to damage done against it. On taking damage of a particular type, this armor "remembers" that damage type. For 10 minutes (or until a new damage type overwrites the "remembered" type), damage done by the remembered type is reduced by 1d4.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, at the cost of AC being temporarily reduced by 1, the armor can magically shift, taking plating from other parts of the body to form a weapon afixed to the arm of the wearer. The wearer can decide whether to make the weapon's damage type piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning. If the wearer dismisses the weapon their lost point of AC is returned to them.
</p>

<div id="Items-Uncommonish-Shell of Dubious Knowledge"><h3 id="Shell of Dubious Knowledge" class="header"><a href="#Items-Uncommonish-Shell of Dubious Knowledge">Shell of Dubious Knowledge</a></h3></div>

<p>
This shell has 4 charges and gains 1D4 charges at dawn.
</p>

<p>
Expend a charge to hold the shell to your ear and it will whisper one "true fact".
</p>


<div id="Items-Uncommonish-Sharing Bands"><h3 id="Sharing Bands" class="header"><a href="#Items-Uncommonish-Sharing Bands">Sharing Bands</a></h3></div>

<p>
Pair of metal bracelets with a small green refractor in each.
</p>

<p>
Once per long rest:
Arcana check (that gets easier with each casting so long as the wearers remain the same)
Success: the two wearers share a "mind space" for 1 minute.
Failure: no effect and can only try again after 1 hour has passed (but does not expend the once per long rest)
</p>

<p>
Additionally, some thoughts occasionally pass through randomly, without intention, and possibly without either wearer realizing it.
</p>

<div id="Items-Uncommonish-Summoning Stone"><h3 id="Summoning Stone" class="header"><a href="#Items-Uncommonish-Summoning Stone">Summoning Stone</a></h3></div>

<p>
A D12 with icons instead of numbers.
Once per long rest you can roll the die
1: the die explodes doing 1d10+2 force damage to everybody in a 10 foot radius
2-12: varying creatures summon for up to 1 minute. The creature acts independently. It will generally have slight preference for the one who rolled the die, but is a completely independent creature.
</p>

<div id="Items-Uncommonish-Dreamers Journy"><h3 id="Dreamers Journy" class="header"><a href="#Items-Uncommonish-Dreamers Journy">Dreamers Journy</a></h3></div>

<p>
Wear this ring while going to sleep.
On using: player describes a dream that their character has during the night and then rolls a D6. On waking, something from the dream follows the dreamer into the waking world...
1-2: it's bad
3-4: it's neutral
5-6: it's good
</p>

<div id="Items-Uncommonish-Circlet of forgetlessness"><h3 id="Circlet of forgetlessness" class="header"><a href="#Items-Uncommonish-Circlet of forgetlessness">Circlet of forgetlessness</a></h3></div>

<p>
On wearing this circlet, you stop forming new memories. Anything that happens is forgotten 30 seconds after it happens.
The following day, all of these forgotten memories return, never to be forgotten again.
</p>


<div id="Items-Uncommonish-Fask of ????"><h3 id="Fask of ????" class="header"><a href="#Items-Uncommonish-Fask of ????">Fask of ????</a></h3></div>

<p>
This small flask refills 3 mouthfulls at dawn. On drinking a mouthful, roll a d20.
</p>

<p>
1:     it's a random negative potion (table to be built out)
2-12:  it's a random mundane drink (water, applejuice, an unidentifiable fruit juice of some kind).
13-19: it's a random magical (flavor) drink (tastes like thunderstorms, the rest of the day the air smells like pine, a faint pink haze edges of your vision, etc...)
20:    it's a random advantagious potion (table to be built out)
</p>

<div id="Items-Uncommonish-Alonzo's Amazing Alloy"><h3 id="Alonzo's Amazing Alloy" class="header"><a href="#Items-Uncommonish-Alonzo's Amazing Alloy">Alonzo's Amazing Alloy</a></h3></div>

<p>
A silver liquid metal. When applied to the skin of a person, it adheres to them but will randomly "patrol" around on their skin as if alive and looking for signs of danger.
</p>

<p>
On taking a physical hit that would cause damage, the liquid metal instantly shifts to the location of the strike, absorbing the hit and negating the damage. This impact shatters the metal causing it to split into dozens of individual beads/droplets. For 24 hours, the impact absorbing function won't work. Also, the individual beads have a tendency to roam and are quite itchy.
</p>

<div id="Items-Uncommonish-Bag Unusual Rope"><h3 id="Bag Unusual Rope" class="header"><a href="#Items-Uncommonish-Bag Unusual Rope">Bag Unusual Rope</a></h3></div>

<p>
A medium bag (think cloth grocery bag size) full of rope. No matter how much rope you pull, it never runs out.
</p>

<p>
Unusual properties:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
if the rope is ever cut, the piece that goes back into the bag remains. But the strand that now has two loose ends telescopes together and vanishes (think Lady and the Tramp spaghetti)

<li>
if a knot is ever tied in the rope, the knot slurps up the entire rope including all the infinite rope from the bag. The end result is 0 rope and a mundane bag

<ul>
<li>
The definition of "knot" is fairly woodgie. The seller describes it as "any point where the rope 'grips' itself"

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Items-Uncommonish-The Pickler's Enmity"><h3 id="The Pickler's Enmity" class="header"><a href="#Items-Uncommonish-The Pickler's Enmity">The Pickler's Enmity</a></h3></div>

<p>
This jar of magical brine will instantly pickle any object put into it. Pickled objects made in this way occasionally have unusual side effects (but are always delicious)
(table of effects to be built out. But generally more RP/flavor oriented than combat impactful (imagine crit fails/successes being the main way this would produce a combat impactful effect))
</p>

<div id="Items-Uncommonish-Delilah's Anti-Pen"><h3 id="Delilah's Anti-Pen" class="header"><a href="#Items-Uncommonish-Delilah's Anti-Pen">Delilah's Anti-Pen</a></h3></div>

<p>
An inky black twig-looking "pen" of 6 inches or so. This pen "unwrites" the writing in any book, paper, patch of dirt, etc... The paper/book/whatever can never hold writing again.
</p>

<p>
Information erased in this way remains stored in the pen and can be recalled by the wielder by focusing on the original medium where the words were taken from.
</p>

<p>
The "unwriting" is more than just "erasing". Any effects, techniques, or magic that attempts to see what was once written there fail to discern what the original writing was.
</p>

<div id="Items-Uncommonish-Potion of Second Chances"><h3 id="Potion of Second Chances" class="header"><a href="#Items-Uncommonish-Potion of Second Chances">Potion of Second Chances</a></h3></div>

<p>
On a failed ability check, a person can drink this potion to reattempt the check without an increased DC. Failing the check a second time will cause the DC to increase as usual.
</p>

<div id="Items-Uncommonish-The Object's Mate"><h3 id="The Object's Mate" class="header"><a href="#Items-Uncommonish-The Object's Mate">The Object's Mate</a></h3></div>

<p>
A small flask of greenish liquid and a small orange refractor.
</p>

<p>
On applying the flask to an object, the liquid melts into the object. On activating the small refractor, it will lightly pull in the direction of the object.
</p>

<p>
This effect works across infinite distance, planes, etc...
