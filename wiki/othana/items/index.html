<h1 id="items">Items</h1>
<h2 id="commonish">Commonish</h2>
<p>These can often be found in shops and such</p>
<h3 id="burst-gem">Burst Gem</h3>
<p><a
href="/othana/lore/refractors#burdening">/othana/lore/refractors#burdening</a>
(blue)</p>
<p>Construction: yellow, blue, [additional blues] Effect: One time use
blue refractor that has been burdened to explode on impact Notes: If
additional blue refractors are used during the creation process, they
are destroyed upon completion of the process and add an additional
damage die based on their sizes. Radius: size of yellow refractor
Damage: size of blue refractor (between a d4 and a d12) piercing</p>
<h3 id="lamp">Lamp</h3>
<p><a
href="/othana/lore/refractors#burdening">/othana/lore/refractors#burdening</a>
(red)</p>
<p>Construction: yellow, red Description: Basically a magical torch.
Bright light in an x radius, dim light in a 2x radius Cost: 20 Notes: x
radius: size of yellow refractor</p>
<h3 id="linking-stones">Linking stones</h3>
<p><a
href="/othana/lore/refractors#burdening">/othana/lore/refractors#burdening</a>
(green)</p>
<p>Construction: yellow, green Description: Telepathic walkie talkies.
Basically Sending Stones but flavor-wise, it’s two people occupying a
temporary shared mind. Experienced as your own thoughts coming to you.
Very confusing experience. 25</p>
<h3 id="life-stone">Life Stone</h3>
<p><a
href="/othana/lore/refractors#burdening">/othana/lore/refractors#burdening</a>
(clouded)</p>
<p>Construction: yellow, cloudedx3 (3 merge into 1 (effectively
destroying 2)) Description: Basically a ranged spare the dieing. On a D6
of 1, the Life Stone is destroyed Cost: 30</p>
<h2 id="uncommonish">Uncommonish</h2>
<p>These can very occasionally be found in shops. More often unique
items created by mechanists.</p>
<h3 id="magical-absorber">Magical Absorber</h3>
<p><a
href="/othana/lore/refractors#burdening">/othana/lore/refractors#burdening</a>
(blue) (ranked 1-9)</p>
<p>Description: A blue refractor that seems to pull ambient magical
energy into itself. Visually, this looks like hard-to-discern heat-waves
of light being slowly drawn into the refractor.</p>
<p>On reaction to a spell being cast activate this item (destroying it)
to re-focus the magical energy of the spell and absorb it into a weapon
of your choosing. The next attack made by this weapon will do 1d4 per
spell level of magical damage. The type of damage done is dependent on
the type of spell cast.</p>
<p>// <span class="todo">TODO:</span> map spell types to element type
(or just wing it?)</p>
<h3 id="beam-sword">Beam Sword</h3>
<p>+1 magical weapon (magical slashing damage) (dynamic, attuned,
infused)</p>
<p>dynamic: grows with the level of the wielder attuned: requires
attunement and takes up one of the players 3 attunement slots infused:
has additional properties/abilities based on the currently bound
refractor</p>
<p>Description: A beam sword with a retractable metal arm that allows
the sword to be deactivated and stowed as a smallish sized object when
not in use.</p>
<p>As a bonus action you can activate or deactivate the beam. When you
use this weapon to make a melee attack, on a hit do an additional 1d4
magical damage of the type currently bound to the weapon. The amount of
additional damage increases at higher levels.</p>
<p>Additionally, unbeknownst to the players at this point, on a critical
hit additional effects occur.</p>
<p>// <span class="todo">TODO:</span> balance this (i.e. dear players:
this is not set in stone) progression rate: 1-5: 1d4 6-10: 2d4 11-15:
3d4 16-20: 4d4</p>
<h3 id="spirit-armor">Spirit Armor</h3>
<p>+1 magical plate armor (same restrictions as heavy plate)</p>
<p>This +1 magical armor can adapt to damage done against it. On taking
damage of a particular type, this armor “remembers” that damage type.
For 10 minutes (or until a new damage type overwrites the “remembered”
type), damage done by the remembered type is reduced by 1d4.</p>
<p>Additionally, at the cost of AC being temporarily reduced by 1, the
armor can magically shift, taking plating from other parts of the body
to form a weapon afixed to the arm of the wearer. The wearer can decide
whether to make the weapon’s damage type piercing, slashing, or
bludgeoning. If the wearer dismisses the weapon their lost point of AC
is returned to them.</p>
<h3 id="shell-of-dubious-knowledge">Shell of Dubious Knowledge</h3>
<p>This shell has 4 charges and gains 1D4 charges at dawn.</p>
<p>Expend a charge to hold the shell to your ear and it will whisper one
“true fact”.</p>
<h3 id="sharing-bands">Sharing Bands</h3>
<p>Pair of metal bracelets with a small green refractor in each.</p>
<p>Once per long rest: Arcana check (that gets easier with each casting
so long as the wearers remain the same) Success: the two wearers share a
“mind space” for 1 minute. Failure: no effect and can only try again
after 1 hour has passed (but does not expend the once per long rest)</p>
<p>Additionally, some thoughts occasionally pass through randomly,
without intention, and possibly without either wearer realizing it.</p>
<h3 id="summoning-stone">Summoning Stone</h3>
<p>A D12 with icons instead of numbers. Once per long rest you can roll
the die 1: the die explodes doing 1d10+2 force damage to everybody in a
10 foot radius 2-12: varying creatures summon for up to 1 minute. The
creature acts independently. It will generally have slight preference
for the one who rolled the die, but is a completely independent
creature.</p>
<h3 id="dreamers-journy">Dreamers Journy</h3>
<p>Wear this ring while going to sleep. On using: player describes a
dream that their character has during the night and then rolls a D6. On
waking, something from the dream follows the dreamer into the waking
world… 1-2: it’s bad 3-4: it’s neutral 5-6: it’s good</p>
<h3 id="circlet-of-forgetlessness">Circlet of forgetlessness</h3>
<p>On wearing this circlet, you stop forming new memories. Anything that
happens is forgotten 30 seconds after it happens. The following day, all
of these forgotten memories return, never to be forgotten again.</p>
<h3 id="fask-of">Fask of ????</h3>
<p>This small flask refills 3 mouthfulls at dawn. On drinking a
mouthful, roll a d20.</p>
<p>1: it’s a random negative potion (table to be built out) 2-12: it’s a
random mundane drink (water, applejuice, an unidentifiable fruit juice
of some kind). 13-19: it’s a random magical (flavor) drink (tastes like
thunderstorms, the rest of the day the air smells like pine, a faint
pink haze edges of your vision, etc…) 20: it’s a random advantagious
potion (table to be built out)</p>
<h3 id="alonzos-amazing-alloy">Alonzo’s Amazing Alloy</h3>
<p>A silver liquid metal. When applied to the skin of a person, it
adheres to them but will randomly “patrol” around on their skin as if
alive and looking for signs of danger.</p>
<p>On taking a physical hit that would cause damage, the liquid metal
instantly shifts to the location of the strike, absorbing the hit and
negating the damage. This impact shatters the metal causing it to split
into dozens of individual beads/droplets. For 24 hours, the impact
absorbing function won’t work. Also, the individual beads have a
tendency to roam and are quite itchy.</p>
<h3 id="bag-unusual-rope">Bag Unusual Rope</h3>
<p>A medium bag (think cloth grocery bag size) full of rope. No matter
how much rope you pull, it never runs out.</p>
<p>Unusual properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the rope is ever cut, the piece that goes back into the bag
remains. But the strand that now has two loose ends telescopes together
and vanishes (think Lady and the Tramp spaghetti)</li>
<li>if a knot is ever tied in the rope, the knot slurps up the entire
rope including all the infinite rope from the bag. The end result is 0
rope and a mundane bag
<ul>
<li>The definition of “knot” is fairly woodgie. The seller describes it
as “any point where the rope ‘grips’ itself”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-picklers-enmity">The Pickler’s Enmity</h3>
<p>This jar of magical brine will instantly pickle any object put into
it. Pickled objects made in this way occasionally have unusual side
effects (but are always delicious) (table of effects to be built out.
But generally more RP/flavor oriented than combat impactful (imagine
crit fails/successes being the main way this would produce a combat
impactful effect))</p>
<h3 id="delilahs-anti-pen">Delilah’s Anti-Pen</h3>
<p>An inky black twig-looking “pen” of 6 inches or so. This pen
“unwrites” the writing in any book, paper, patch of dirt, etc… The
paper/book/whatever can never hold writing again.</p>
<p>Information erased in this way remains stored in the pen and can be
recalled by the wielder by focusing on the original medium where the
words were taken from.</p>
<p>The “unwriting” is more than just “erasing”. Any effects, techniques,
or magic that attempts to see what was once written there fail to
discern what the original writing was.</p>
<h3 id="potion-of-second-chances">Potion of Second Chances</h3>
<p>On a failed ability check, a person can drink this potion to
reattempt the check without an increased DC. Failing the check a second
time will cause the DC to increase as usual.</p>
<h3 id="the-objects-mate">The Object’s Mate</h3>
<p>A small flask of greenish liquid and a small orange refractor.</p>
<p>On applying the flask to an object, the liquid melts into the object.
On activating the small refractor, it will lightly pull in the direction
of the object.</p>
<p>This effect works across infinite distance, planes, etc…</p>
