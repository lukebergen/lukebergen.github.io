<p>
Throughout the world, players can run into ocean gates. Some are sealed with license requirenments but most aren't (it's harder to regulate them).
</p>

<p>
They tend to be smaller than island-bound ruins, but they're also harder to find so they tend to go unlooted (and un-cleared-out). As a result, they tend to be easier to explore but also harsher and more rewarding.

<p>
The elevator down opens to a large (100 foot circumference) dome room. The elevator itself is in the center of the room with its opaque shaft (15 foot circumference) leading up and out the top of the dome.
</p>

<p>
The floor is less a floor than it is a grid of 1x1 square columns jutting up from unseeably deep, with gaps as wide as the squares (think checkerboard where dark squares are ground and white squares are huge holes).
Coming up from between the gaps is a gentle orange glow. Movement requires a DC 12 acrobatics or athletics check. On fail, move as though in difficult terrain.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the door of the elevator closes behind the party, they hear the sound of the single unique reaver behind the elevator shaft activate. Roll initiative.
</p>

<p>
Spider's Grid Reaver:
A Large-size tank-like reaver that is deceptively dexterous. It has 8 razor-sharp spider-like appendages that it deftly moves around on, never missing a step as it scuttles about on the grid-floor. These legs are 10 feet long, giving the creature "reach" when attacking with them.
It looks like a chain-link mesh surrounding a bright crackling sphere of blue light. The legs are attached directly to the chain link mesh and the joins seem to be able to slide around the grid such that arms can become legs, legs can become arms, etc...
</p>

<p>
Attacks:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
basic swipe attack

<ul>
<li>
It slashes out with one of its claw-like appendages (can swipe twice)

<li>
Melee attack against one creature within range

</ul>
<li>
razor spin

<ul>
<li>
It plants 1 leg beneath itself and spins in place like a twisted metallic ballerina

<li>
Melee attack against all creatures within 10 feet of creature

</ul>
<li>
sonic slice

<ul>
<li>
It crosses its arms in an X and then slides them across each other in a sharp cutting motion causing a loud screeching sound

<li>
Ranged spell attack against one target. Force damage

</ul>
<li>
Tile crush

<ul>
<li>
It reaches down to the side of the pillar one of its legs is standing on, jams its leg into a hole on the side of the pillar and twists

<li>
All players roll a die. All players with an odd roll must make dex saves. Players take damage (or half damage) as their tiles shoot up from below smashing into the domed ceiling above

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
After the fight, as the players are recovering, a wet slapping sound alerts them to a monstrosity crawling up out of the space between the floor tiles.
</p>

<p>
Appearance:
From the waist down it looks like a fairly standard humanoid even having remnants of pants-like material hanging in tatters from a rope belt.
From the waste up, however, it more so resembles an enormous blob of formless flesh with eyes, mouths, ears, and hair in random locations. Two long appendages stick out from around the shoulderish area then end in long clawed bird-like claws.
</p>

<p>
The creature will immediately try to make for the exit and escape. If the players interfere it will try to throw them off to continue its escape. If players force it into battle, it can make some rough smashing/slashing attacks or a single magical radiant burst attack that throws everybody back.
</p>

<p>
If/when the creature escapes, it is never heard or seen of again.
