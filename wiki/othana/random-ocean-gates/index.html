<h1 id="random-ocean-gates">Random Ocean Gates</h1>
<p>Throughout the world, players can run into ocean gates. Some are
sealed with license requirenments but most aren’t (it’s harder to
regulate them).</p>
<p>They tend to be smaller than island-bound ruins, but they’re also
harder to find so they tend to go unlooted (and un-cleared-out). As a
result, they tend to be easier to explore but also harsher and more
rewarding.</p>
<h2 id="spiders-grid">Spider’s Grid</h2>
<p>See <a href="/othana/misc/dataclips">/othana/misc/dataclips</a> The
Part of Us We Leave Behind.</p>
<p>The elevator down opens to a large (100 foot circumference) dome
room. The elevator itself is in the center of the room with its opaque
shaft (15 foot circumference) leading up and out the top of the
dome.</p>
<p>The floor is less a floor than it is a grid of 1x1 square columns
jutting up from unseeably deep, with gaps as wide as the squares (think
checkerboard where dark squares are ground and white squares are huge
holes). Coming up from between the gaps is a gentle orange glow.
Movement requires a DC 12 acrobatics or athletics check. On fail, move
as though in difficult terrain.</p>
<p>As soon as the door of the elevator closes behind the party, they
hear the sound of the single unique reaver behind the elevator shaft
activate. Roll initiative.</p>
<p>Spider’s Grid Reaver: A Large-size tank-like reaver that is
deceptively dexterous. It has 8 razor-sharp spider-like appendages that
it deftly moves around on, never missing a step as it scuttles about on
the grid-floor. These legs are 10 feet long, giving the creature “reach”
when attacking with them. It looks like a chain-link mesh surrounding a
bright crackling sphere of blue light. The legs are attached directly to
the chain link mesh and the joins seem to be able to slide around the
grid such that arms can become legs, legs can become arms, etc…</p>
<p>Attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>basic swipe attack
<ul>
<li>It slashes out with one of its claw-like appendages (can swipe
twice)</li>
<li>Melee attack against one creature within range</li>
</ul></li>
<li>razor spin
<ul>
<li>It plants 1 leg beneath itself and spins in place like a twisted
metallic ballerina</li>
<li>Melee attack against all creatures within 10 feet of creature</li>
</ul></li>
<li>sonic slice
<ul>
<li>It crosses its arms in an X and then slides them across each other
in a sharp cutting motion causing a loud screeching sound</li>
<li>Ranged spell attack against one target. Force damage</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tile crush
<ul>
<li>It reaches down to the side of the pillar one of its legs is
standing on, jams its leg into a hole on the side of the pillar and
twists</li>
<li>All players roll a die. All players with an odd roll must make dex
saves. Players take damage (or half damage) as their tiles shoot up from
below smashing into the domed ceiling above</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>After the fight, as the players are recovering, a wet slapping sound
alerts them to a monstrosity crawling up out of the space between the
floor tiles.</p>
<p>Appearance: From the waist down it looks like a fairly standard
humanoid even having remnants of pants-like material hanging in tatters
from a rope belt. From the waste up, however, it more so resembles an
enormous blob of formless flesh with eyes, mouths, ears, and hair in
random locations. Two long appendages stick out from around the
shoulderish area then end in long clawed bird-like claws.</p>
<p>The creature will immediately try to make for the exit and escape. If
the players interfere it will try to throw them off to continue its
escape. If players force it into battle, it can make some rough
smashing/slashing attacks or a single magical radiant burst attack that
throws everybody back.</p>
<p>If/when the creature escapes, it is never heard or seen of again.</p>
