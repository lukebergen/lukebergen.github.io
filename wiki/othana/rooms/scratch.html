<ul>
<li>
Entrance room

<ul>
<li>
Not much here. Just the bottom of the elevator shaft

</ul>
<li>
Residential district

<ul>
<li>
When you walk through the door, your first instinct is that you've found a secret exit from the ruin it's so teaming with life

<li>
In the center floating in mid-air is a sun-like object spreading bright light

<li>
below sun is pedestal with what at first appears to be a huge vertical oval but on closer inspection is actually an extremely fine refractor rotating impossibly fast with a thin beam of rainbow color extending to the sun above

<ul>
<li>
If players destroy it, the entire room basically goes into "moon" like light as the sun fades and they can search the rubble for some loot

</ul>
<li>
4 4x4 grids of rooms sit in the corners of this mega-room

<ul>
<li>
if players choose to explore them, for each explored one roll a d4

<ul>
<li>
1: random fight

<li>
2: describe an abandoned residential room (random flavor)

<li>
3: a trap leading into result of re-roll (ignoring further 3s)

<li>
4: treasure

<li>
at any point, if an interesting idea hits you, improv it so long as it doesn't contradict what this whole mega-room is all about (residential district)

<li>
also, can just use to give them plot devices and such

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Big Cube Room

<ul>
<li>
thin metal rods stick out from the walls irregular intervals (6 feet)

<li>
6 rows of 8x8x8 foot cloudy blue cubes

<li>
there's a door on the other side of the room

</ul>
<li>
Drill room

<ul>
<li>
Dominated by a massive black cylinder extending from the floor to the high ceiling but with a gap of about 8 feet in the middle

<ul>
<li>
cylinder leading into the ground has a spiral pattern to it

</ul>
<li>
Contains 4 Grunts and a Sentry

<li>
Scraps of loose metal and stuff. Players can make an investigation check

<ul>
<li>
A good result might find some refractors

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Charging room

<ul>
<li>
Lots of Grunts embedded in the walls.

<li>
They won't do anything unless one is touched. If that happens, 1 d8 of them wake up and attack (if they're the attacking type

<li>
Also if feeling spicy, have everybody stealth check their way through

</ul>
<li>
Sorting room

<ul>
<li>
little delivery bots move bits and bobs from openings to other openings in the wall

<li>
players can make rolls or just roll every few seconds for things being moved from hole to hole

<li>
if players take something from one of the bots they just look a little confused and then go back to moving other things around

<ul>
<li>
if players take 4 items give it 1 minute and then Sentry arrives

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Store room

<ul>
<li>
no enemies

<li>
just treasure in extra-dimensional cube-like storage spaces

</ul>
</ul>
