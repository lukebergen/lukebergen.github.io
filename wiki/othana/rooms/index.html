<p>
Rooms are generic areas that adventurers might potentially run into when exploring a gate.
</p>

<p>
Some rooms (many of them actuall) are unique to a particular gate
</p>

<div id="Rooms-Processing Room"><h2 id="Processing Room" class="header"><a href="#Rooms-Processing Room">Processing Room</a></h2></div>

<p>
The room is quite large. Around the edges of the room thin metal rods jut out of the walls at irregular intervals
</p>

<p>
In the center of the room 6 rows of 8 foot cubes sit atop long tables. One of these rows has an extra cube. It is a mimic.
</p>

<div id="Rooms-Residential District"><h2 id="Residential District" class="header"><a href="#Rooms-Residential District">Residential District</a></h2></div>
<p>
Unique to Smyrna
</p>

<p>
This is a "super room" in that it contains many things including elements from other types of rooms
</p>

<p>
An enormous room in the shape of a cube. Unlike nearly all other rooms, this one is teaming with life.
An artificial sun sits in the sky just below the highest point of the dome. This sun is (largely) powered by
a rapidly spinning crystal on the ground at the center of the room. If destroyed (magical force field and a ton of HP
and healing make this a very difficult task) the sun dims to become more moon-like in its light output.
</p>

<p>
Things that can be found in this room:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Residential buildings (flavor to taste) that act like "Residence" rooms

</ul>
<div id="Rooms-Residence"><h2 id="Residence" class="header"><a href="#Rooms-Residence">Residence</a></h2></div>

<p>
These are rooms that were used as residences by the ancients. They may contain nothing, lore-related things, treasures, or enemy encounters.
