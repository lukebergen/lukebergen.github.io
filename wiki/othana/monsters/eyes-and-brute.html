Behavior
The Eyes and Brute work together in tandem and are always found as a set.
</p>

<p>
The Eyes take no actions and have no speed. Their only purpose is to keep track of the location of an enemy.
</p>

<p>
The Brute spends its turn mindlessly running into the nearest enemy.
If its paired Eyes are destroyed or incapacitated it ceases all movement and action.
</p>

<p>
Action: On its turn, if it's paired eyes are aware of an enemy present, it will use its speed to run into the nearest such opponent.
