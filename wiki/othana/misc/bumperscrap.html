"BumperScrap" (a dice game)
Buy in with a copper
All players secretly roll 2d6
Players can then optionally "bump" (raise the stakes) at most 1 time. "I bump to 4". "Well I bump to 6!", etc...
Once everybody has "bumped" once or elected not to bump at all, all players must buy in up to this highest bump
At this point, players can choose to re-roll one of their dice
At that time, highest sum-of-dice wins the pot. Ties split the pot.
The only rule/caveate is that if at any time both of the players dice show the same number, they instantly lose and are out of the game.

<p>
As simple enchantment cause the dice to make an audible noise on rolling the same number. This prevents cheating.
