<p>Throughout Othana, bits of scrap exist that people have yet to find a
purpose for. As a result, they are often melted down for raw material or
just passed back and forth as a form of generic currency. Having no real
purpose beyond this, nobody ever suspected the stories these bits of
scrap contained. These are some of those stories.</p>

for the Sky (regarding the nighttime earthquakes on Smyrna)</h2>

<p>The door of the tavern bursts open and a towering house of a man
steps inside, beaming. “I have a daughter! I’m a papa! Next round’s on
me!” the man exclaims to the cheers of the rest of the patrons. The man
saunters to the bar barely able to contain his joy. He drops 10 scrap on
the bar and nods to the man already pouring the drinks.
“Congratulations, Haran”, the barkeep says. “To her health”, he toasts,
raising one of the glasses. The barkeep continues pouring drinks for the
rest of his customers as he pockets the scrap. One of which, is
DataClip#f8e19e6b-4746-4404-a017-4c420c04e049 This is part of the story
that it contains.</p>
<p>Log 731.8 Haman So many mouths to feed. This was a mistake. We should
have left them to the ark. I do not understand Abimelech’s reasoning. I
will admit, the boy has at least proven useful. I suppose a handful of
warm bodies to handle the grunt work is not the worst thing. Still, I
worry about this much unpredictability in such unnatural circumstances.
I suppose time will tell.</p>
<p>Log 741.3 Haman The others have determined that the psychological
need for a sense of open space must not be ignored. Energy diversion
from primary activities shall be incurred one day for every 5 days of
primary energy use. I have never been more certain that the future must
rely on Enoch’s reaver technology.</p>
<p>Log 773.6 Haman The fire was devastating. 80% of systems are offline.
I have become a rat trapped in the maze of my own making. Still. The
project must continue at all costs.</p>
<p>Log 773.7 Haman And still that “Residential area” drains resources.
I’d give half my logs to get to the panel that would shut down that
insane energy hog.</p>
<p>Log 774.2 Haman We will run out of energy before long at this rate.
Abimelech’s experiments require more and more energy. We will have to
dig. The aether is thicker the deeper we go. It isn’t a perfect solution
as we’re bound to hit bedrock eventually which could cause the local
area to become geologically unstable. But, that shouldn’t become an
issue for a few millennia at least.</p>

<p>A young man swears frustratedly. “Ahhh no fair. You cheated.” “We
didn’t say we had to stick to the path. Pay up” his friend replies.
Disgruntled at having lost the wager, the young man reluctantly hands
over 10 scrap. Unbeknownst to either of them, one of the bits of
circuitry that changes hands that day was
DataClip#9e201fc7-b825-4917-803e-7f5fb197f9a6. Its contents are as
follows.</p>
<p>Log 387.3 Hiram The last of my assistants have left me. Naphtali. You
disappoint me. At least acknowledge how much the sun set means to you.
You say it’s about the work, but I see the real truth. I see that you’re
really just after a comfortable goodbye. You never really believed in
what we’re trying to accomplish here. But I forgive you. All for the
better in fact. Now I have no distractions. I can focus on the work.</p>
<p>Log 388.1 Hiram I do miss having an ear to bounce my thoughts off of.
I can’t help but feel a little unanchored without somebody to question
me or check my work.</p>
<p>Log 389.7 Hiram Strength increased. Healing properties. Able to
regrow simple organs. The risk has been worth it. I’ve never felt better
and I’m convinced that the future of the project has never been more
sure.</p>
<p>Log 733.8 Hiram Enoch is a genius! This is how we can finally
unburden ourselves from these sloppy flesh housings. I’ll admit, I was
beginning to panic a bit. Like I was too many wrong turns down the maze
to find my way back. But this will simplify everything. Then I can get
back to the work again. No more concerns for my own personal
housing.</p>
<p>Log 733.9 Hiram It’s all gone wrong. Horribly horribly wrong. Nothing
should have remained after the transfer. Why is that thing still moving
around. Oh gods it’s trying to get to the lift. I can’t let it get out.
I was supposed to have been moved over entirely without any duplication.
But if there’s something left animating that hack and a half of flesh I
left behind, what part of me am I missing?</p>
