Throughout Othana, bits of scrap exist that people have yet to find a purpose for. As a result, they are often melted down for raw material or just passed back and forth as a form of generic currency. Having no real purpose beyond this, nobody ever suspected the stories these bits of scrap contained. These are some of those stories.

The door of the tavern bursts open and a towering house of a man steps inside, beaming.
"I have a daughter! I'm a papa! Next round's on me!" the man exclaims to the cheers of the rest of the patrons.
The man saunters to the bar barely able to contain his joy. He drops 10 scrap on the bar and nods to the man already pouring the drinks.
"Congratulations, Haran", the barkeep says. "To her health", he toasts, raising one of the glasses.
The barkeep continues pouring drinks for the rest of his customers as he pockets the scrap. One of which, is DataClip#f8e19e6b-4746-4404-a017-4c420c04e049
This is part of the story that it contains.

So many mouths to feed. This was a mistake. We should have left them to the ark. I do not understand Abimelech's reasoning.
I will admit, the boy has at least proven useful. I suppose a handful of warm bodies to handle the grunt work is not the worst thing.
Still, I worry about this much unpredictability in such unnatural circumstances. I suppose time will tell.

The others have determined that the psychological need for a sense of open space must not be ignored.
Energy diversion from primary activities shall be incurred one day for every 5 days of primary energy use.
I have never been more certain that the future must rely on Enoch's reaver technology.

The fire was devastating. 80% of systems are offline. I have become a rat trapped in the maze of my own making. Still. The project must continue at all costs.

And still that "Residential area" drains resources. I'd give half my logs to get to the panel that would shut down that insane energy hog.

We will run out of energy before long at this rate. Abimelech's experiments require more and more energy.
We will have to dig. The aether is thicker the deeper we go. It isn't a perfect solution as we're bound to hit bedrock eventually which could cause the local area to become geologically unstable. But, that shouldn't become an issue for a few millennia at least.

A young man swears frustratedly. "Ahhh no fair. You cheated."
"We didn't say we had to stick to the path. Pay up" his friend replies. Disgruntled at having lost the wager, the young man reluctantly hands over 10 scrap. Unbeknownst to either of them, one of the bits of circuitry that changes hands that day was DataClip#9e201fc7-b825-4917-803e-7f5fb197f9a6. Its contents are as follows.

The last of my assistants have left me. Naphtali. You disappoint me. At least acknowledge how much the sun set means to you.
You say it's about the work, but I see the real truth. I see that you're really just after a comfortable goodbye. You never really believed in what we're trying to accomplish here.
But I forgive you. All for the better in fact. Now I have no distractions. I can focus on the work.

I do miss having an ear to bounce my thoughts off of. I can't help but feel a little unanchored without somebody to question me or check my work.

Strength increased. Healing properties. Able to regrow simple organs. The risk has been worth it.
I've never felt better and I'm convinced that the future of the project has never been more sure.

Enoch is a genius! This is how we can finally unburden ourselves from these sloppy flesh housings.
I'll admit, I was beginning to panic a bit. Like I was too many wrong turns down the maze to find my way back.
But this will simplify everything. Then I can get back to the work again. No more concerns for my own personal housing.

It's all gone wrong. Horribly horribly wrong. Nothing should have remained after the transfer.
Why is that thing still moving around. Oh gods it's trying to get to the lift. I can't let it get out.
I was supposed to have been moved over entirely without any duplication. But if there's something left animating
that hack and a half of flesh I left behind, what part of me am I missing?
