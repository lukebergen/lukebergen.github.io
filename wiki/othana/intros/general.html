<p>
Othana is a world covered by endless water.
</p>

<p>
Most people in this world find themselves content to farm, raise cattle, or perform any of the other mundane tasks necessary to maintain a comfortable life on the handful of habitable islands that remain above the sea.
</p>

<p>
Others, however, develop a wanderer's spirit and take to the water. Trading news and resources between islands.
Some become pirates. Ransacking trader ships, cities, and any other profitable establishment lacking the resources to pay for protection.
</p>

<p>
And then there are the diggers. A small, disconnected group of people who move from island to island exploring ruins underground and beneath the sea. These diggers, while few in number serve a vital purpose within modern life. The prizes they bring back from their adventures can be found everywhere. Refractors, a powerful energy source found in these ruins, power modern magic and machinery alike.
</p>

<p>
The cultures of the varied islands in this world differ wildly. Especially as concerns the diggers.
Some revile them, seeing them as desecrators of the holy.
Others admire them as brave adventurers, working tirelessly to discover new technology for the betterment of all the peoples of Othana.
Most are just glad to see them come back from the ruins, packs full of strange loot.
</p>

<p>
The majority of these island states, however, have come to a kind of informal agreement. A licensing system allows the most talented of the diggers to explore the more dangerous ruins while keeping away those who would likely simply not return.
</p>

<p>
Like an informal guild, the diggers guard their secrets closely. If any child knew how best to handle a reaver the market for artifacts wouldn't be so lucrative. As a result, little is known about the diggers or what they encounter below ground. Only that they certainly earn their pay.
