<p>
Players start on a ship headed to Smyrna looking to check out its c-gate
</p>

<p>
They have sea adventure getting there. Possibly spot the ocean-gate off the west coast of the island.
</p>

<p>
They reach the beach of Smyrna, help the captain unload his product, and start heading along a path toward the city
</p>

<p>
On the way there they encounter twins Tina and Tony treed by some wild boars.
After players fight off the boars the twins exclaim over meeting diggers and escort the party to their father the mayor.
</p>

<p>
Along the way, they show the party the minor1 gate (currently protected by an invisible force field. (twins try to prank party into running into it))
</p>

<p>
They walk through city following twins to the mayors office where an irate Abigail is trying to get the mayor to do something about her missing husband.
Party may overhear that she is upset that her husband Eli has gone into minor1 and has been down there long enough that she's starting to worry.
Mayor can't do anything about it as the usual crew for handling such things are off trying to track down pirates.
</p>

<p>
Mayor enlists help of party to bring back Eli (which they'd need to do anyway since their admittance machine is on the fritz and he's the only one who knows how to fix it)
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Players make their way back out to minor1 and explore that
</p>

<p>
They find Eli stuck in SpawnRoom hiding up on one of the cylinders surrounded by reavers.
</p>

<p>
After rescuing him, he thanks them, tells them to come visit him in his shop, and runs for the exit. Players can continue exploring or leave.
</p>

<p>
At this point it's probably getting late. Players spend the night at the local inn.
</p>

<p>
Next morning on returning to the mayors office we find that Eli is just finishing up fixing the admittance machine that will allow players to pass through the barrier around c-gate
</p>

<p>
Players then exit the city to the south-east and see the pasture area
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Large open pasture area that slopes up to the north. Contains minor2, c-gate, Miriam the tortle, the twins (helping Miriam), and 3 shepherds John, Levi, and Ira playing a dice game.
</p>

<p>
At this point, players can talk with Miriam, the shepherds, explore minor2, or explore c-gate.
</p>

<p>
c-gate gets them to the point where they realize they need a key to progress further into the ruin. minor2 is a fairly large ruin which somewhere contains an uncharged key needed to open the door in c-gate ruins.
</p>

<p>
If asked, Eli will explain that the key needs to be charged but that he doesn't know how to do that. He explains that a fellow student studied this type of thing and currently studies on Galatia.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Players begin their ocean journey to Galatia to look look for information about the "key" they found in one of the ruins.
</p>

<p>
On their way there, they found the "Spiders Grid" ocean gate. They fought the monster there, earning a decent chunk of loot.
