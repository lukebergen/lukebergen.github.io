<p>
While traveling in the general area of <a href="../locations/galatia/index.html">/othana/locations/galatia/</a> the Genasi of the party notices their green refractor from home calling to them.
They have a mind to mind communication with someone from home telling them that "a brother" is in distress. Depending on some checks, they get some amount of details about where he is.
He's being held drugged/captive by one of the less ethical scholars of the university
Need to more fully flesh out Galatia and the NPCs there before figuring out how this could potentially be resolved.

<p>
Samson gets fan mail regularly, this time, there's something more like a plea.
The creatures that Samson slew have returned and the Tortles are having trouble holding them off.
Players will travel to <a href="../locations/corinth/index.html">/othana/locations/corinth/</a> and meet with local Tortles to get filled in.
They'll travel (blind-folded style?) to the Tortle spawning grounds island and investigate.
They find clues leading them to search to the west (out beyond the edge of most maps).
There they find a small island with all these creatures (TBD). How players deal with this is up to them. Maybe the creatures are repelled by something that the players can INT their way into finding. Maybe they just kill them all.
More details to be fleshed out.
