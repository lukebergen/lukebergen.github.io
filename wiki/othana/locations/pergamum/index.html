<p>
Home of the dragonborn
</p>

<p>
Occasionally visited by dragons themselves, though this is rare and the Dragonborn would never communicate this with a non-Dragonborn.
</p>

<p>
There are some gates though these are largely dormant
</p>


<div id="Pergamum-scratch/thoughts"><h2 id="scratch/thoughts" class="header"><a href="#Pergamum-scratch/thoughts">scratch/thoughts</a></h2></div>

<p>
What leads players to explore the ruines here? Dragonborn avoid the gates the same way the Eloi avoid the "wells" of the Morlocks.
</p>

<p>
Scene: they find a large room with a 3-story tall dragon held perfectly still by chains, harnesses and such. It has glas tubes, metal rods, and bits of machinery all over its body such that it appears to be half flesh, half machine.
</p>

<p>
It remains perfectly still except its eyes which track the party.
</p>

<p>
If the party attempts to interact with it, it speaks in their minds "free me" and nothing else.
</p>

<p>
If the party frees the creature (mechanics tbd), it will approach a panel, mess with some nobs which cause a lot of grinding screeching noises from above. Just before it departs, it looks to the group and says:
</p>

<p>
"Beware, little ones. There are monsters in this place"
</p>

<p>
Before launching out of the room through the ceiling, a crash of glass, earth, and metal falling into the room.
