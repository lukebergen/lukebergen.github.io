<p>
The area around the main cluster of islands is called "The Wilds".
</p>

<p>
There is no clear marker or delineation for when you move from "safe waters" into "the Wilds". So it's usually referred to in terms like "deep into the Wilds" or "at the edges of the Wilds" and similar, indicating just how far you get from the known territories.
</p>

<p>
Not many people explore the Wilds. Those who do often don't return. Those who do find their way back report strange occurrences. Uncharted islands that they can never find their way back to again. Anomalous weather patterns and bizarre visual displays. Ocean gates with ruins that behave strangely and contain reavers not seen elsewhere. 
</p>

<p>
Navigation in the Wilds also becomes bizarre. Some, believing that there is more to the world than just these main islands, have picked a direction and sailed straight away only to find themselves returning to one of the main islands but from a different direction. A few futile attempts were made to chart the Wilds. Every map ever charted has always proven to be faulty. Showing islands where none now exist. Ocean gates popping up where the map claims only empty, open waters.
</p>

<p>
Many theories exist to explain the wilds but nobody really knows for sure what they are or why they behave the way that they do. The only thing anybody can really agree upon is that they are dangerous and only the brave or reckless would bother trying to explore them.
</p>

<p>
To most, there are only "the Wilds". But some who have flirted with its edges will tell you that there are certainly the "deep" Wilds that are completely unnavigable. But the "shallow" Wilds (while impossible to chart on a map) can sometimes be navigated by those who know the area or have the necessary senses.
</p>

<p>
Examples of locations in the shallow Wilds:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Tortle breeding grounds

<li>
Small cottage islands where reclusive outlanders live away from civilization

<li>
more to come...

</ul>
