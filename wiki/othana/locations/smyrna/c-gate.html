<p>
E: Entrence
G: glass walls containing neat rows of various bits of metal and refractors shifting
D: elevator Down
A: Assessment gas room (room fills with cloudy white gas. All doors locked. Gas does no harm. Filters out. Next door opens)
W: Door welded shut from the other side
L: Large locked door
</p>
<ul>
<li>
To the right is a recess (religion 12+ shows it's a keyhole)

<li>
Leads to <a href="c-gate-part2.html">c-gate-part2</a>

</ul>
<p>
Pool test:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If players step into the room more than 5 feet, a glass half-glob in the ceiling notices them

<li>
The moment they make a movement away from the center of the room, the floor goes out. But they can move closer to the center

<li>
On floor going out:

<ul>
<li>
They find themselves in a 60x60x60 pool

<li>
The "floor" now above them snaps back shut

<li>
No light. Another sound like the doors opening but muffled by water

<li>
Corpse/bones of a shark are flushed into the pool

<li>
If a player makes contact with the shark bones

<ul>
<li>
floor/ceiling opens

<li>
grate at bottom of pool begins rising to raise them up out of the water

<li>
once it reaches ground level, floor snaps shut again

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Eyes&amp;Brute Fight
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In this room are 2 sets of <a href="../../monsters/eyes-and-brute.html">/othana/monsters/eyes-and-brute</a>

<li>
Once all players walk in, fight breaks out immediately

<li>
All doors are locked until enemies are all destroyed

</ul>
<p>
Mastermind test:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Immediately enter initiative (players go first, then the room goes)

<li>
25' wide coridor 50' long

<li>
On the rooms turn, 5 foot slanted pillars shoot up making contact with the ceiling

<ul>
<li>
If a player is on one of these spaces, they take 1d4 blugeoning and are thrown back to the start of the room

<li>
To make it to the end players must move through the coridor one space at a time

<li>
Memorizing where will be safe to stand next time the pillars come

</ul>
<li>
Pattern here looks like this: (- = safe X = pillar)
