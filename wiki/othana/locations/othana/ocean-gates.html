<p>
Ocean gates can be found all over Othana. Their entrances stick out of the ocean without any kind of fanfare.
</p>

<p>
They are generally smaller than the gates one would find on the islands. But they can also be more lucrative to explore since they are generally harder to find and plot. So, smaller, less well known (and therefore less "cleared out already") = short exploration, more dangerous, better loot.
</p>

<p>
Examples:
</p>

<div id="Ocean Gates-Ocean Gates"><h2 id="Ocean Gates" class="header"><a href="#Ocean Gates-Ocean Gates">Ocean Gates</a></h2></div>

<p>
Usually picked at random unless in some way plot relevant, in which case, usually referenced via the nearest island. e.g. <a href="../smyrna/ocean-gate-north-west.html">/othana/locations/smyrna/ocean-gate-north-west</a>
</p>

<div id="Ocean Gates-Ocean Gates-01"><h3 id="01" class="header"><a href="#Ocean Gates-Ocean Gates-01">01</a></h3></div>

<p>
Somewhere in the oceans of Othana...
