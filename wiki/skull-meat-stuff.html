<h2 id="scratch-notes-for-next-therapy-session">scratch / notes for next
therapy session</h2>
<p>context: during a weeknight. Took some edibles. Craving a drink.
Feeling that mindset of “yeah… I know all that stuff we’ve thought when
driving to work in the morning and how you want a nicer body. How we’re
destroying our body for it when it’s not even really all that great of
an experience anymore. ALLLLL that jazz. So determine to ‘turn things
around’”. Definitely gonne have a drink tonight even though I was
planning not to.</p>
<p>I know that I don’t <em>really</em> want to do this. So some part of
me starts trying to argue myself out of it. I think all those same
thoughts again at myself. “it’s killing you”, “you’re fucking up your
brain”, “it’s probably making you feel worse with all the
depression/anxiety stuff”. And to each of these, I (me in the drivers
seat) have a retort for every one. “I don’t care”. Conversation
ensures</p>
<p>A: So what? I know all those things are true. But right now, this is
what I want. And I want it enough that it’s worth the trade-offs. How
about for once, I’ll do what I <em>want</em> instead of what I’m worried
about B: But “trade-offs” is all wrong. These nights of drinking are
nice, but they don’t offset the time / happiness loss for <em>all the
rest of the time</em>. You’re being selfish. A: Am I being selfish, or
are you just not selfish enough? Maybe I am selfish and thoughtless, and
being short-sighted. So what. I’m not trying to optimize for my own
happiness like a perfectionist. I’m not thinking, I’m just doing.
Enjoying what I want, because I can. Even if it is bad for future-me.
Fuck that guy. I’m the one here right now and I’ll do what I want. If
you’re so concerned about the outcomes of my actions, put that
perfectionism to use and mitigate my shit. In the mean time, fuck off B:
Integration? Don’t we want to find some happy medium here? A: Fuck. Off.
The medium between your perfectionism and my raw id is still a place
where we’re “reasonable” 99% of the time. Like being the one person in a
class of 100 who votes for plain pizza. It’s not that he gets pizza his
way 1% of the time. He gets outvoted <em>EVERY</em> time. Soooo, fuck
being out voted. When I get my hands on the wheel, I’ll do things my way
B: Yeah… this is why you don’t see the light of day much. Because you’re
selfish and hurt other people (yourself included) for your own
enjoyment. You put yourself well above others and that makes you a
fundamentally bad person no matter how you calculate it. So yeah. In a
very real way, you’re <em>a</em> bad part of me that I try to give as
little control to as possible. It’s called “trying to be a good person”
A: So what. I’m like, the villain here. Or a personification of all the
things you consider “bad”? B: There’s other ways of being bad. You just
represent one interesting collection of them. Not even really sure how
much of it is just the drinking either. You seem to embody like, a whole
weird amalgum of things I consider “bad” (yes, I know that’s reductive).
Sorry A: Side effect of perfectionism maybe? Parts like me who are
“failures” or “human” are just so unacceptable, you can’t (or won’t)
integrate (): what if it’s just a strategy we need. Rather than this
fighting back and forth or some hamfisted “accepting yourself”, what if
we did it like a contract. Make concessions of each other. Instead of
going <em>right</em> to integration, let’s at least first get a little
friendlier B: Yeah, we’ve tried that remember? That’s why the million
“ok, I’ll eat lunch, but no drinking” always fail, because when he gets
his hands on the wheel, every deal under the sun seems to go out the
window. He can’t be relied upon to hold up his end (): Ok, what if you
made it so that you hold up your end of things <em>only</em> if he holds
his up end first. (I won’t eat lunch tomorrow if you drink tonight) B:
Yeah, have tried that too remember. It’s the closest thing to working
we’ve had. But I ended up bearing the brunt of it and went deeper into
perfectionism trying to make up for his nonsense. I can only be so good
to make up for his selfish bullshit</p>
<p>How do I be good enough to make up for how bad I am?</p>

<h3
id="what-would-you-tell-yourself-as-a-child-in-those-sad-moments">what
would you tell yourself as a child in those sad moments?</h3>
<p>Different things depending on my mood (apparently)</p>
<h4 id="angerdisgust">anger/disgust</h4>
<p>Stand up for yourself. You’re right to get angry. It’s your turn.
Stand up for yourself. Fight. Get angry. It’s your right. God you whiny
little cry-baby. “ooohh whoa is me. Nobody cares about me. Nobody’s
protecting me. I’d rather just be sad.” Fuuuuuuck you. Go hork down a
bunch of food to make yourself feel better you fat little baby. Oooh
nooooo. He’s crying now. I hurt its feelings. God you probably
<em>should</em> just crawl away and die. What good is a little doormat
that only knows how to feel sorry for itself.</p>
<p>Fuck. Even typing this out and now <em>I’m</em> starting to feel sad.
Your self-pity germs are contagious. Gross. Gods I hate remembering you
or interacting with you. It makes me feel like you’ll infect me with
this… whatever this gross self-indulgent, pity-wallowing, cowardly,
entitled, childishness is.</p>
<h4 id="universe-me">universe-me</h4>
<p>It’s ok bud. I know. It’s sad to feel alone and like they don’t care
about what you want/need. It’s not their fault. They are what they are.
Unaware, selfish. Humans are just like that sometimes. But it’s ok.
We’re more than that. In those moments when you feel alone and sad,
those are the moments when you start to really feel like your true self.
Here. Try this. Close your eyes and imagine yourself alone in a field at
night with the stars and whatnot. Now imagine that everybody on the
planet is gone. Wiped out by a plague or whatever. It’s just you and the
stars and the grass. Now imagine yourself not being there and notice how
still and calm everything is. You are part of that and it is part of
you. Now take a deeeeeep breath. Feel like you’re breathing in that calm
stillness and feel how it is part of you and you are part of it. This is
the real you. You’ll always feel a little bit sad because you are still
human. But you’re also this. And the peace from this place can help make
the sadness almost feel sweet too. They’ll never know you or be able to
understand you. Because they cannot and will not ever be able to
understand this. In that way, you should feel bad for them. They’ll run
around with all their human things going on. Live, make more humans,
die. On and on they’ll go. But you’ll always be here. Like the eye of
the storm. And they’ll never understand that or you. So it’s ok to be
yourself here. Just… learn to be human too. It’s what they’ll expect and
you do still need food and water and stuff to keep your body going and
whatnot. But don’t forget who you really are. OH! And lean into it too.
Be as weird as you want. The best people value different perspectives.
So be your weird little self as much as you like. And the people that
like that and want to be around it, stick with them. And the ones who
are put off by it, screw them. They’re the ones who only value sameness
and conformity and fuck that.</p>
