Info from the speak easy
</p>

<p>
A couple of the missions are a little easier to stomach, stealing from rich assholes. There's one in particular in Boston: a wealthy alchemist who's been in league with the Simeon and seems to be making BANK.
</p>

<p>
There's also an ask to steal something from the Chainswords...
</p>

<p>
(you're able to piece together that the heist is on Maury: the alchemist up at the Copperworks that Ramage (the alchemist you sold to in Boston) loathes)
</p>

<p>
As for the fences, this guy knows 'em all. But let's make a persuasion check to see what he's willing to tell you!
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Landri: Mako's old fence, a gnome; rumor has it that Landri had the plague and was taken across the wall to North Boston

<li>
Banna: replaced Landri (you met her, Evony made her the dagger); Banna arrived in town only recently, no one had ever heard of her before she took over Landri's book, she's been doing well for herself

<li>
Prigka: an orcish fence that operates in North Boston; used to be installed down in Providence, but took up residence under Simeon's recent rule of Boston; foul-tempered and unreliable

<li>
Nasuda Hisachi: a human fence that once was set up in South Boston, but has since moved to North Boston; savage, cruel, but with an extensive network and a reputation for obtaining exceptionally difficult-to-find goodsâ€”especially deadly ones

</ul>
<p>
Thiri conversation:
Thiri hails from one of the oldest "gnomish" settlements in the Empire: Alexandria. His grandfather fancied himself a bit of a scholar and used to tell Thiri the story of Alenxandria's founding.
The town is named after a long-distant relative of Thiri's, Philip Alexander, said to be one of the very first gnomes. Just before the Founding, Philip had given a large portion of this estate to the colony of Virginia to establish a trade center. Just a year after the House of Burgesses approved the establishment of a town and the county surveyor laid out street lanes and town lots, the world was hit by the Founding. A disproportionate number of Alexandrian residents were Founded on the Other Side and so Philip reacquired his land and determined to set up a place to study the Founding, the Seven, and the Bond.
Philip's interests were far-ranging and people quickly came from far and wide to study at the Alexander estate. One of these was Ramala Silvereye, whose academic pursuits had led her to befriend Alexander some years earlier. Post-Founding, Ramala came to Alexander in person to discuss their mutual research interest: Aer.
In the years that followed, Ramala and Philip were full partners, laying the foundations for what we know today to be the Bond. Eventually, Ramala became increasingly adept at wielding the Bond and began teaching lessons. Just before his untimely death in 1758 (G.E. 3), Philip had bankrolled Ramala in the creation of a school named in her honor and specially serving students of the Bond.
By the 1800s, Ramala was still going stong. Pupils began commenting that it seemed as though Ramala had hardly aged, except that she had shrunken in stature and looked even frailer than usual. Ramala Silvereye is believed to have been the first gnome.
As more and more people began to identify themselves as gnomish, Philip's  cousin (the only other Alexander to have escaped the Founding) agreed to allow interested pupils to stay on his estate to train with Ramala. Thus Silvereye was born.
It was quickly apparent that those with the highest degree of talent were somehow being changed.
