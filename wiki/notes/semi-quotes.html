Do I really look like such a good person to you?

A good person...?

No one exists who suits everyone.
That’s why if you don’t do what I ask, to me you’ll be a bad person.

In order to have the greatest impact on the things around you, you must have a flexible self. When a force moves toward you, attempting to break or bend you, you only reinforce its rigidity by remaining rigid yourself. Instead, be flexible and let the other in. As it comes in, you now choose its trajectory, it's shape, in terms of how you adapt and relent space. In this way, by giving up space, you change the shape of your adversary. And if done wisely, you'll have changed them into a shape more manageable than if you'd remained rigid to begin with.
