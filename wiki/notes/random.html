oh yeah, shower thought: tl;dr: memory and prediction <em>could</em> be (but probably are not) the same thing. Human brain actually treats past and future similarly in a lot of ways. One day-dream I find myself running over and over is just reliviing my life over and over again just to see all the different branches that could happen. So imagine if every time you die you're just reborn as yourself but with your memory intact. Now imagine 400 lifetimes later you're having a conversation where you break down and are just honest (for the 8th time (but this time is slightly different)).
‚ÄùYeah &lt;best friend from 198, enemy from 92, etc..&gt; it's really weird... &lt;moment of pure honesty&gt; this is my 472 lifetime. I've lived and died 450ish lifetimes. I've honestly lost track. There's only so much you can remember. It all blends together after a while."

"Ok. Let's just say that I believe you. What happens to me in the future? I mean, if you've lived out your life already, you should know what happens to me eventually right?"

"Honestly, 450ish different things. I can give a general idea of what happens. About 100 times you end up a miserable oaf that wishes they'd left town when they had a chance with Candice (95% of the times of which was a possible choice). But 4 times you end up happy for staying."

All of that. This prediction/probabilistic-based seeing of things is no different from predicting what might be. You imagine infinite universes and play an odds game of which universe is the most likely to be the real one in which we currently exist. But how different is that from "remembering" 1000 pasts? Are any of those "pasts" especially real? Are any of those potential futures more "real" than any others?
