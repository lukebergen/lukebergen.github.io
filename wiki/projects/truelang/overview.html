<p>
In the beginning, the <a href="gods/index.html">Gods</a> were alone.
Then they found one another and began to speak.
The universe and everything that occurs in it is a side-effect of this speech.
</p>

<p>
Humans communicate with one another using languages of their own. As a result, to a degree, humans can use the language of the gods to bend the universe to their will.
<a href="Scholars.html">Scholars</a> who study this language, how it works, and how to make use of it call it "True Language".
The minds of the gods and the minds of humans are vastly different things. It takes a great deal of mental energy to comprehend the words of the true language.
Furthermore, meanings and words shift over time/usiage, so words spoken one day might have a different meaning the next day.
</p>

<p>
To speak a command a person has to understand all of the words of the command. Understanding these words takes a huge amount of mental effort (MP).
Spell books describe the words of given commands but since the language shifts and changes over time, if a human puts the mental effort into understanding "sphere of fire moves from my hand 12 feet in the direction my arm points" on Monday, but the words for "hand", "feet", and "fire" change on Wednesday, then that human will have to put in the mental effort to learn those words again on Wednesday before being able to cast the spell.
</p>

<p>
So the contents of a spell book seem to constantly change over time (at least from a humans perspective). Once an understood word has changed, its meaning is lost to that human until and unless they re-expend the mental effort to learn its new sound. More specifics can be found in <a href="Spellcraft.html">Spellcraft</a>.
