<p>
There are some number of Gods who speak amongst themselves. Their speech is what causes the universe to be and to change over time.
</p>

<p>
Not much is known of them other than that there are multiple of them. It's theorized that the goings on in the world reflect the nature of the interactions of the Gods. For example, a chaotic storm followed by a beautiful spring day might be the result of a violent dispute followed by a reconciliation.
</p>

<p>
Some pray to the Gods but so far as anyone can tell, they don't seem to be interested or even aware of their impact on their creation.
</p>

<p>
The chanter gods chant the base normalcy script over and over. The universe runs as a variation on this base monologue. Other gods have conversations that overtake and modify this <a href="chant.html">chant</a>. But in the silence of the other gods (and the silence of magic speakers), all would eventually revert to the behavior as defined by the chant of these base chanter gods.
</p>

<p>
The god <a href="valsi.html">Valsi</a> is a linguist. His study of Truelang translates into a knowledge and observation of the universe. As a result, he's the only god to have an awareness of the goings on of the universe as events in and of themselves. When he noticed that some of the patterns seemed to communicate with one another using something like language, he became curious and created the dictionary books to see if humans could learn to use Truelang via the binding words.
</p>

<p>
He did this by making an agreement with <a href="Vlipa.html">Vlipa</a>. Whenever any being within the spoken universe expresses a Speakable Word, Vlipa translates it to Truelang and speaks it for them.
