<p>
Base game is the battle royal mode where 20 players are loaded in to the 9x9 grid thing where players duke it out over a finite-but-looping space.
</p>

<p>
Intro style game mode: players have 4 or 5 levels showcasing moving quickly from left to right or up to down (or whatever to whatever). The point is, some introductory levels to set users up to understand everything they might encounter in the other mode. The Weekly-RNG thing...
</p>

<p>
But second game mode... Every day/week/month/whatever, RNG generates for everybody a new level type/path. Players compete for the fasted route through the new level. Top players earn coins for cosmetics or something.
</p>


<p>
A third input button, the full-stop. It stalls all movement, allowing for finer grained movement mid-air... Maybe? Seems geared toward higher level play...
</p>

<p>
Need at least one more button (I think?) for when to be in attack mode. On a cool down so you can't just spam it. While moving and attack mode engaged, running into opponents kills them (unless they're in the same state. In which case, clank)
