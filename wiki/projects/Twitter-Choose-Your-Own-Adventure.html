<div id="Starting room"><h1 id="Starting room" class="header"><a href="#Starting room">Starting room</a></h1></div>

<ol>
<li>
You wake up. Your head is pounding. Your mouth dry. You seem to be in a small room with stone walls. "How did I get here?", you wonder.

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Try to remember what happened (064)

<li class="done4">
Look around the room (594)

</ul>
<li>
You look around and see a small desk and chair, a wardrobe, a barred window, the door to the hallway (closed), and the cot that you're lying on.

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Examine the desk (729)

<li class="done4">
Examine the wardrobe (259)

<li class="done4">
Examine the barred window (795)

<li class="done4">
Try the door (181)

<li class="done4">
Lay back down (009)

</ul>
<li>
You lay back down on the uncomfortable cot and try to relax. Worrying about these things never improves a situation. Before long, you nod off. Apparently you were more tired than you realized. You're awoken some time later by the sound of boots approaching.

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Go to (388)

</ul>
<li>
You see a small desk with writing implements. A quill, ink, some parchment, and a small handful of books.

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Read the books (435)

<li class="done4">
Continue searching the room (594)

</ul>
<li>
You pick up one of the books and begin leafing through it. It's a story about a prince, a mage, and a dragon. You find yourself so engrossed by the story that you hardly notice time passing till suddenly, the sound of hurried boots outside the door pulls you back to reality

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Go to (388)

</ul>
<li>
You open the doors of the wardrobe and look around. You see a few sets of common servants clothing. The clothes hang from some hooks and wire which themselves hang from a metal rod

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Use the hooks to pick the lock on the door (779)

<li class="done0">
Use the metal bar to pry the bars from the window (055)

<li class="done4">
Continue searching the room (594)

</ul>
<li>
You've seen your friends do this trick a hundred times, but you just can't seem to get the hang of it. After a bit your concentration is broken by the sound of boots on stone and they're headed this way!

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Go to (388)

</ul>
<li>
The bars on the window, while thin, simply won't budge. Maybe if you could get some leverage. But bare handed you can do nothing here.

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Go to (594)

</ul>
<li>
You insert the metal rod through the bars in the window and push to the side attempting to pry the bars apart. Putting all your weight into it you begin to see progress. A small gap in the bars admits your head and shoulders. The wall seems uneven, the stones jutting out here and there. Looking down you see a long drop to the moat below. From somewhere above you hear the wind take on a strange rhythm almost as if the air were breathing.

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Climb down toward the moat (344)

<li class="done4">
Climb up toward the sound (127)

<li class="done4">
Return to the room (729)

</ul>
<li>
Things begin well. You make it about a quarter of the way down when the stones begin to feel slick with moisture. As you reach for your next handhold, you feel the stone beneath your left foot break away from the wall and you fall.

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Go to (521)

</ul>
<li>
You manage to climb the wall to the top of what appears to be a tall tower. And there, curled up in a ball is a large dragon. Everything about its posture gives the impression that it's sleeping, except it's eyes. Its eyes look directly at you. "Here you are then. I've been sent for you. Make haste". The dragon stands, stretches, and motions to you with it's claws. It seems to want you to climb onto its back.

<ul>
<li class="done0">
Climb on to the beasts back (538)

<li class="done4">
This thing clearly just wants to eat you. Dive for the moat and hope for the best (521)

</ul>
<li>
You try the door but it seems to be locked and won't budge. You throw your weight into it, but being only a child, the effort accomplishes nothing.

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Go to (259)

</ul>
<li>
The wind whips past as you fall. From this height, even landing in water, you can tell this is going to hurt. You crash through the surface and sink to the bottom. The impact is brutal and you find your vision going dark around the edges. As you feel yourself begin to slip into unconsciousness you feel the strange sensation of a hand entering your chest and pulling. You wake in a wood. Looking around you see an old man in funny clothes and a tall hat stoking a fire. You've been warned about strangers (and this is one strange looking stranger). But he did save you. Didn't he?

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Sneak away (324)

<li class="done0">
Approach the old man (367)

</ul>
<li>
You sneak away and begin running as you put distance between yourself and the small campsite. After a while you find a road. You recognize this road. To the left lies the open country. To the right lies home... and whatever trouble brought you to be locked away.

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Go left (745)

<li class="done0">
Go right (044)

</ul>
<li>
You follow the road out into the country. You may never learn what happened to your home. But you'd always been an adventurous sort and the life of a highborn can be so tedious. The End.

<li>
The door swings wide and a group of 3 armored men walk into the room. "You'll come with us now" one of them says.

<ul>
<li class="done0">
Resist (041)

<li class="done0">
Go with them peacefully (910)

</ul>
<li>
Still to do

</ol>
<p>

324: sneak away from wizard
367: approach wizard
538: get on dragons back
521: dive for mote
344: climb down

</p>

<div id="Starting room-Memories"><h2 id="Memories" class="header"><a href="#Starting room-Memories">Memories</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
Still to do

<li>
Chased in the dark. People running in panic. Torches lighting your way as you run through the castle. You hear a small cry from a doorway. Peeking into the kitchens, you see a large man standing over a small boy

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Aid the boy (324)

<li class="done0">
Keep running (798)

</ul>
<li>
You run into the room. As you approach the man he doesn't seem to have noticed you. Getting closer he seems far larger than he did from the doorway. He intimidates the crying boy bellowing "Where is she?!". He seems dangerous. Maybe violent. You notice a knife on a table.

<ul>
<li class="done0">
Stab at the man (221)

<li class="done4">
Try to reason with him (018)

</ul>
<li>
"whoa, what are you doing to this boy?" you say to the man. He startles and spins on his heel, nearly losing his balance. "Oh there you are" he laughs, relieved, as he plants his gauntlet into the side of your head. "Thought you might've flown the coup" you hear him say as your vision fades to darkness. The sound of pounding boots approaching the door pulls you back from these memories.

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Go to 388

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
221: (stab the brute and run with the kitchen boy)
390: (ignore kitchen boy and keep running)
