<h1 id="starting-room">Starting room</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>You wake up. Your head is pounding. Your mouth dry. You seem to be
in a small room with stone walls. “How did I get here?”, you wonder.
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Try to remember what
happened (064)</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Look around the room
(594)</label></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You look around and see a small desk and chair, a wardrobe, a barred
window, the door to the hallway (closed), and the cot that you’re lying
on.
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Examine the desk
(729)</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Examine the wardrobe
(259)</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Examine the barred window
(795)</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Try the door
(181)</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Lay back down
(009)</label></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You lay back down on the uncomfortable cot and try to relax.
Worrying about these things never improves a situation. Before long, you
nod off. Apparently you were more tired than you realized. You’re awoken
some time later by the sound of boots approaching.
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Go to (388)</label></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You see a small desk with writing implements. A quill, ink, some
parchment, and a small handful of books.
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Read the books
(435)</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Continue searching the
room (594)</label></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You pick up one of the books and begin leafing through it. It’s a
story about a prince, a mage, and a dragon. You find yourself so
engrossed by the story that you hardly notice time passing till
suddenly, the sound of hurried boots outside the door pulls you back to
reality
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Go to (388)</label></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You open the doors of the wardrobe and look around. You see a few
sets of common servants clothing. The clothes hang from some hooks and
wire which themselves hang from a metal rod
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Use the hooks to pick the
lock on the door (779)</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Use the metal bar to pry
the bars from the window (055)</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Continue searching the
room (594)</label></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You’ve seen your friends do this trick a hundred times, but you just
can’t seem to get the hang of it. After a bit your concentration is
broken by the sound of boots on stone and they’re headed this way!
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Go to (388)</label></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The bars on the window, while thin, simply won’t budge. Maybe if you
could get some leverage. But bare handed you can do nothing here.
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Go to (594)</label></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You insert the metal rod through the bars in the window and push to
the side attempting to pry the bars apart. Putting all your weight into
it you begin to see progress. A small gap in the bars admits your head
and shoulders. The wall seems uneven, the stones jutting out here and
there. Looking down you see a long drop to the moat below. From
somewhere above you hear the wind take on a strange rhythm almost as if
the air were breathing.
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Climb down toward the
moat (344)</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Climb up toward the sound
(127)</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Return to the room
(729)</label></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Things begin well. You make it about a quarter of the way down when
the stones begin to feel slick with moisture. As you reach for your next
handhold, you feel the stone beneath your left foot break away from the
wall and you fall.
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Go to (521)</label></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You manage to climb the wall to the top of what appears to be a tall
tower. And there, curled up in a ball is a large dragon. Everything
about its posture gives the impression that it’s sleeping, except it’s
eyes. Its eyes look directly at you. “Here you are then. I’ve been sent
for you. Make haste”. The dragon stands, stretches, and motions to you
with it’s claws. It seems to want you to climb onto its back.
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Climb on to the beasts
back (538)</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />This thing clearly just
wants to eat you. Dive for the moat and hope for the best
(521)</label></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You try the door but it seems to be locked and won’t budge. You
throw your weight into it, but being only a child, the effort
accomplishes nothing.
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Go to (259)</label></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The wind whips past as you fall. From this height, even landing in
water, you can tell this is going to hurt. You crash through the surface
and sink to the bottom. The impact is brutal and you find your vision
going dark around the edges. As you feel yourself begin to slip into
unconsciousness you feel the strange sensation of a hand entering your
chest and pulling. You wake in a wood. Looking around you see an old man
in funny clothes and a tall hat stoking a fire. You’ve been warned about
strangers (and this is one strange looking stranger). But he did save
you. Didn’t he?
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Sneak away
(324)</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Approach the old man
(367)</label></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You sneak away and begin running as you put distance between
yourself and the small campsite. After a while you find a road. You
recognize this road. To the left lies the open country. To the right
lies home… and whatever trouble brought you to be locked away.
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Go left
(745)</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Go right
(044)</label></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You follow the road out into the country. You may never learn what
happened to your home. But you’d always been an adventurous sort and the
life of a highborn can be so tedious. The End.</li>
<li>The door swings wide and a group of 3 armored men walk into the
room. “You’ll come with us now” one of them says.
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Resist (041)</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Go with them peacefully
(910)</label></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="memories">Memories</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Still to do</li>
<li>Chased in the dark. People running in panic. Torches lighting your
way as you run through the castle. You hear a small cry from a doorway.
Peeking into the kitchens, you see a large man standing over a small boy
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Aid the boy
(324)</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Keep running
(798)</label></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You run into the room. As you approach the man he doesn’t seem to
have noticed you. Getting closer he seems far larger than he did from
the doorway. He intimidates the crying boy bellowing “Where is she?!”.
He seems dangerous. Maybe violent. You notice a knife on a table.
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Stab at the man
(221)</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Try to reason with him
(018)</label></li>
</ul></li>
<li>“whoa, what are you doing to this boy?” you say to the man. He
startles and spins on his heel, nearly losing his balance. “Oh there you
are” he laughs, relieved, as he plants his gauntlet into the side of
your head. “Thought you might’ve flown the coup” you hear him say as
your vision fades to darkness. The sound of pounding boots approaching
the door pulls you back from these memories.
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked="" />Go to 388</label></li>
</ul></li>
