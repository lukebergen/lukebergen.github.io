<h1 id="the-blandest-redemption">The Blandest Redemption</h1>
<p>I come to noticing 2 things: first, loss. Grayness. That feeling when
you know you were going to do something and were excited about it but
now can’t remember what it was. Second, blood. Not my own, others. Then
the flashing lights, emergency responders and their warm blankets. I’m
safe. But only because I pretend to be a victim.</p>
<p>Ok, I know that I actually am a victim. Nothing I did as a thrall can
be held against me. I wasn’t in my right mind. It doesn’t matter. I
don’t like to think about that. I’ve decided to track down everybody who
I’ve hurt and try to make amends.</p>
<p>So here’s this guy in a bar. “hey” I prod. And his big dumb face just
gawks at me. I’d eaten his wife about 2 months prior (no, literally).
The memory makes my stomach clench and I have to hold back an
involuntary gag. He’s wearing a grotesque Hawaiian shirt and flip flops.
“Can I help you” he blands (I can’t think of a better way to describe
this poor slob expressing itself).</p>
<p>I explain myself and my mission (not framed like that) and how
miserable I feel about everything that I put him and his wife through.
Blah blah blah. The usual routine. I get the usual response. Confusion,
revulsion, rage, anguish. He cries. I walk back to my car.</p>
<p>I’m sitting in the woods. I reach out with a part of my mind that
didn’t exist a year ago (probably doesn’t exit at all (I’m just lying to
myself. We know this)). Nothing responds. I sigh with every dead ember
of my being. I had tasted immortality and then felt it ripped away from
me as if it was a mortal sin. And it was. I know it was. I should feel
guilty. I should feel bad. And I do. I really do. I just… my head’s
still a little fucked up about it ok?</p>
<p>Anyway, one more gods-damned name scratched off my list. I’m barely a
tenth of the way through and that fucker only had me enthralled for one
year.</p>
<p>Out of nowhere, I remember the first time we met. Gazing into those
eyes. Those sad, deep, endless voids. My body going chill but something
deeper inside waking up for the first time. You could get lost in those
eyes. I did. How many years did He live? How uncaring does someone
become after that much time spent avoiding whatever this emptiness is.
This gray, mundane, Hawaiin shirt, flip-flop-a-thon.</p>
