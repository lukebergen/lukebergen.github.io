<p>
I come to noticing 2 things:
first, loss. Grayness. That feeling when you know you were going to do something and were excited about it but now can't remember what it was.
Second, blood. Not my own, others. Then the flashing lights, emergency responders and their warm blankets. I'm safe. But only because I pretend to be a victim.
</p>

<p>
Ok, I know that I actually am a victim. Nothing I did as a thrall can be held against me. I wasn't in my right mind. It doesn't matter. I don't like to think about that. I've decided to track down everybody who I've hurt and try to make amends.
</p>

<p>
So here's this guy in a bar. "hey" I prod. And his big dumb face just gawks at me. I'd eaten his wife about 2 months prior (no, literally). The memory makes my stomach clench and I have to hold back an involuntary gag. He's wearing a grotesque Hawaiian shirt and flip flops. "Can I help you" he blands (I can't think of a better way to describe this poor slob expressing itself).
</p>

<p>
I explain myself and my mission (not framed like that) and how miserable I feel about everything that I put him and his wife through. Blah blah blah. The usual routine. I get the usual response. Confusion, revulsion, rage, anguish. He cries. I walk back to my car.
</p>

<p>
I'm sitting in the woods. I reach out with a part of my mind that didn't exist a year ago (probably doesn't exit at all (I'm just lying to myself. We know this)). Nothing responds. I sigh with every dead ember of my being. I had tasted immortality and then felt it ripped away from me as if it was a mortal sin. And it was. I know it was. I should feel guilty. I should feel bad. And I do. I really do. I just... my head's still a little fucked up about it ok?
</p>

<p>
Anyway, one more gods-damned name scratched off my list. I'm barely a tenth of the way through and that fucker only had me enthralled for one year.
</p>

<p>
Out of nowhere, I remember the first time we met. Gazing into those eyes. Those sad, deep, endless voids. My body going chill but something deeper inside waking up for the first time. You could get lost in those eyes. I did. How many years did He live? How uncaring does someone become after that much time spent avoiding whatever this emptiness is. This gray, mundane, Hawaiin shirt, flip-flop-a-thon.
