<p>
It's dark. Not dark like the night. There are no stars or moon to light the streets. More like the kind of dark that an eclipse brings. It feels like it should be brighter, but isn't. A pale, gray, monochrome.
</p>

<p>
Two figures walk through the street talking.
</p>

<p>
"Say Achy, wanna go down to the pier and watch the water?"
"I suppose. Let's have a bite first though."
</p>

<p>
&lt;have a "bite" from some of the frozen humans in a convenience store&gt; &lt;show how time is frozen&gt;
</p>

<p>
At the pier watching the waves (one of the few things left in the world that moves, albeit rhythmically. Like a 4 second song left on repeat)
</p>

<p>
&lt;short conversation about the waves moving&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;Ligament asks Ache why he figures time has ended&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;this leads to question about running out of souls to eat. Will we eventually starve?&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;let's go ask the old one&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;they travel for a while talking about the nature of living forever. "kill or be killed. Eat or be eaten" theme first comes up explicitly&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;eventually reach the old one and ask questions&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;it's revealed that time has not ended altogether. Only for these two. They're experiencing their last seconds of life&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;Ligament becomes horrified to discover that they're not some demon but a human, like the people who's souls they'd been consuming all this time&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;Ache couldn't care less&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;the two argue about it for a bit until Ligament asks Ache if Ache would consume their soul&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;Ache: "Yes. I suppose if it came down to me or you"&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;Ligament: Well, if I'm so near death regardless, I'd rather just have done with it. Have my soul will you, Achy?&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;Ache: moment of hesitation. I'll be lonely&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;Ligament: I won't do this anymore Achey. You'll be alone soon enough regardless&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;Ache refuses&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;the two part ways&gt;
</p>
