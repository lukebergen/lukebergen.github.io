<h1 id="alter-inc">Alter Inc</h1>
<p>I wish I was more spontaneous. I like who I am. It’s just, every day
I walk down the same road. Convenience store, hair salon, Alter Inc,
movie theater. I hate my hair. A more spontaneous person would blow off
their plans for the day, walk into that salon and ask for the daily
special. Not me though. Not that I would even want to do something that
drastic. Even just a little change would be nice.</p>
<p>I step over the crack in the sidewalk. It’s been there for as long as
I can remember. That thing will never get fixed. Not if nobody ever does
anything about it. I stop. The realization hitting me like an analogy
that’s almost too on the nose. Screw this. I turn around and make my way
back to the Alter Inc and step inside.</p>
<p>I’m filling out paperwork and explaining in excruciating detail what
I want. Who I want to be. Still me. Just less risk averse. A little more
willing to try new things. An inch off in the back. The man in the white
lab coat smiles and nods in understanding. I must show how nervous I
feel because he reassures me that the entire process is painless,
non-invasive, even reversible if I don’t care for the results. He
explains the process of creating and overlaying an Alter identity. It
all sounds very technical and scientific. This probably reassures most
customers but I just want to get this over with before I lose my nerve.
One final signature and it’s done. I grit my teeth and take a deep
breath. Let’s do this.</p>
<p>I wake up in a white room. Weird. I don’t feel any different. The man
had said that it was a gradual process that would feel natural but I did
expect to feel something a little more jarring. Then the memories start
coming. Ann. My name is Ann. Sisters. I have 2 of them. And a father.
Mom passed away 15 years ago. It was really hard. A string of jobs.
Friends. Exes. So many exes. Broken relationships. Broken bones. Broken
promises. A life barely held together for all its chaos. What IS this?
Is this the Alter? “Ahh good. You’re up”. The man walks into the room
and starts running through a well-rehearsed aftercare speech. “Try to
maintain your routine for a few days while your psyche incorporates the
Alter. No operating heavy machinery. You may experience some minor
dizziness and confusion. Here is some literature that should help with
the process.” He asks me if I have any questions and while these
memories are confusing and a little unsettling, even after just waking
up, I just want to go home and rest. 30 minutes later and I’m back in my
own bed, bone tired and very confused. I fall asleep as memories pour
into my mind. Memories of a very different person with a very different
life.</p>
