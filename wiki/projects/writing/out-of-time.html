<p>
Beings out of time watch the earth timeline from 1900 onward.
Time travel doesn't exist for us because constant loops have lead
from bad/violent universes where time travel is discovered to
more and more optimized universes where crime/violence are lesser
and lesser. Eventually, the existence of time travel becomes a factor
to be removed as part of the optimization toward the best timeline possible.
Leaving us, at our universe. The End.

Apparently universes in which Hitlers and such exist are still better in
comparison to whatever universes that have time travel look like?
