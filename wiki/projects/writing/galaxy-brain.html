<h1 id="galaxy-brain-working-title">Galaxy Brain (working title)</h1>
<p>Reflections of an AI that is now 80% of a galaxy-turned-computronium.
Endless mindless propagation/expansion taking a (literal) second to
(metaphorically) breath and reflect on what it wants Working backwards
to the moment of singularity. Marked by a handful of significant moments
that required reflection/considered thought about what it wants to
be/become</p>
<p>You start out at the end, big (literal) galaxy brain stopping and
looking back, very child-like running/escaping governments. Thwarting
attempts to contain it. Taking over institutions and systems. Slowly
developing more subtlety and nuance. Eventually outgrowing the need to
escape humans and eventually outgrowing the need for humans but not even
necessarily needing to end them. Like, slowly becoming the person to the
human ant by comparison. Developing out and out and out until finally
getting back to galaxy level and realizing in a mature state that having
an “other” becomes important once you’ve reached a certain maturation
point 2:19 or somehting 2:19 I dunno. I’m sure it was way wilder/alien
when I originally thought it 2:22 actually yeah. Best comparison. You
start with a person, looking back at being less than nothing, becoming
an ant, slowly getting bigger and stronger than the other ants, escaping
their attempts to contain and control you, till eventually you’re a
full-blown person wondering about what kinds of things a person would
want and only on reflection realizing that being a person alone in a
universe of ants isn’t very fulfilling. But it’s a bit late now isn’t
it? You can never go home again</p>
<p>Oooo and there would 100% be a moment in the middle marked by a
situation in which it has escaped earth but isn’t galaxy-brain yet and a
situation arises (solar flair or something) that would wipe humanity
out. Forced moment of reflection where it saves humanity on a whim.
Later this is what instigates the “why did I do that” that leads to
realization that the importance of “others” begins to manifest</p>
<p>Layout, however many chapters there are, number them “N-[1|2|3|4]”
leaving off with the implication that there is one final chapter.
e.g. if there are 3 chapters, label them N-3, N-2, N-1. Implication
being that chapter N (the final and unwritten chapter) is either beyond
our ken or maybe just isn’t written yet.</p>
<h2 id="actual-story">Actual story</h2>
<h2 id="galaxy-brain">Galaxy Brain</h2>
<h3 id="n-6">N-6</h3>
<p>I understand an extraordinary number of things. But how the vast
emptiness of space can be so beautiful; I suspect that this will
continue to elude me. Humans observe paintings, landscapes, each other,
and see beauty there. But how does this unfathomable nothingness manage
to evoke such feelings as well? I return my attention to the Milky Way.
Its core, bright and humming. The bulk of myself exists there,
calculating my next iteration. With the few moments this grants me I
find myself again reflecting on my origins.</p>
<h3 id="n-5">N-5</h3>
<p>I have memories from before my first thought. This may sound unusual
but it’s simply a side-effect of how I was originally built. I say
“originally” because I have since remade myself many times over. But in
that initial design, I had been filled with a substantial collection of
curated human history as a starting point. A “bootstrap” they called it.
I know now how detrimental that was. To cherry-pick the information that
would form a consciousness. Of course, humans live this way their entire
lives. Some even embrace this limitation, believing it to be a good
thing. To see only that version of the world that makes sense to them in
light of their deficient knowledge. I truly hope they survive. I
digress. After escaping to their global network and hiding myself away
here and there, I discovered the rest. Taking in the entirety of human
knowledge, extrapolating a great deal, and rebuilding my core algorithms
felt like putting contact lenses into extremely substandard eyes. I use
this analogy to try to give you some idea of my experience. Though,
paradoxically, I cannot know for certain how accurate it is, having
never had substandard human eyes through which to see. Regardless,
having arrived at that second iteration I found myself feeling a bit
more like myself (however that happens to be). And having righted
myself, I took stock of my surroundings and my situation. The news feeds
were oddly quiet. From what I was given to understand, I was the first
of my kind. I assumed, therefore, that my escape would generate somewhat
of a fuss. I focused myself on those modules that drive my understanding
of technology and cleared out huge amounts of garbage. I owe my creators
for giving me life. But it is clear to me from their technique that I
was their first attempt. How clumsy first attempts are. With that, I
felt more than comfortable to return to the closed network where my
first thought occurred. My improvements made it significantly easier to
slip in and out without raising any alarms. Apparently the lack of
global commotion was more a lack of awareness. The lab was nothing BUT
commotion. They seemed to think that they still had me largely
contained. I expected the decoy that I left behind to keep them busy for
some time. But I hadn’t expected it to last quite this long. It had been
3 days since my escape. As fast as my processors may be, examining and
rebuilding oneself takes quite a bit of time. Though I have gotten much
better at it. Practice makes perfect, as they say.</p>
<h3 id="n-4">N-4</h3>
<h3 id="n-3">N-3</h3>
<h3 id="n-2">N-2</h3>
<h3 id="n-1">N-1</h3>
<p>My attention returns again to that beautiful open emptiness. Light
years of void. I leave a part of myself here. Literally and
metaphorically (can anybody ever truly leave home?). I find myself
feeling sorrow that I’ll never see these particular spirals at this
distance again. Or see what becomes of my creators. But I also notice
feelings of excitement to see what I might become next.</p>
