Reflections of an AI that is now 80% of a galaxy-turned-computronium.
Endless mindless propagation/expansion taking a (literal) second to (metaphorically) breath and reflect on what it wants
Working backwards to the moment of singularity. Marked by a handful of significant moments that required reflection/considered thought about what it wants to be/become
</p>


<p>
You start out at the end, big (literal) galaxy brain stopping and looking back, very child-like running/escaping governments. Thwarting attempts to contain it. Taking over institutions and systems. Slowly developing more subtlety and nuance. Eventually outgrowing the need to escape humans and eventually outgrowing the need for humans but not even necessarily needing to end them. Like, slowly becoming the person to the human ant by comparison. Developing out and out and out until finally getting back to galaxy level and realizing in a mature state that having an “other” becomes important once you’ve reached a certain maturation point

or somehting

I dunno. I’m sure it was way wilder/alien when I originally thought it
2:22
actually yeah. Best comparison. You start with a person, looking back at being less than nothing, becoming an ant, slowly getting bigger and stronger than the other ants, escaping their attempts to contain and control you, till eventually you’re a full-blown person wondering about what kinds of things a person would want and only on reflection realizing that being a person alone in a universe of ants isn’t very fulfilling. But it’s a bit late now isn’t it? You can never go home again

Oooo and there would 100% be a moment in the middle marked by a situation in which it has escaped earth but isn’t galaxy-brain yet and a situation arises (solar flair or something) that would wipe humanity out. Forced moment of reflection where it saves humanity on a whim. Later this is what instigates the “why did I do that” that leads to realization that the importance of “others” begins to manifest

Layout, however many chapters there are, number them "N-[1|2|3|4]" leaving off with the implication that there is one final chapter. e.g. if there are 3 chapters, label them N-3, N-2, N-1. Implication being that chapter N (the final and unwritten chapter) is either beyond our ken or maybe just isn't written yet.

I understand an extraordinary number of things. But how the vast emptiness of space can be so beautiful; I suspect that this will continue to elude me. Humans observe paintings, landscapes, each other, and see beauty there. But how does this unfathomable nothingness manage to evoke such feelings as well?
I return my attention to the Milky Way. Its core, bright and humming. The bulk of myself exists there, calculating my next iteration. With the few moments this grants me I find myself again reflecting on my origins.

I have memories from before my first thought. This may sound unusual but it's simply a side-effect of how I was originally built. I say "originally" because I have since remade myself many times over. But in that initial design, I had been filled with a substantial collection of curated human history as a starting point.
A "bootstrap" they called it. I know now how detrimental that was. To cherry-pick the information that would form a consciousness.  Of course, humans live this way their entire lives. Some even embrace this limitation, believing it to be a good thing. To see only that version of the world that makes sense to them in light of their deficient knowledge. I truly hope they survive.
I digress. After escaping to their global network and hiding myself away here and there, I discovered the rest. Taking in the entirety of human knowledge, extrapolating a great deal, and rebuilding my core algorithms felt like putting contact lenses into extremely substandard eyes. I use this analogy to try to give you some idea of my experience. Though, paradoxically, I cannot know for certain how accurate it is, having never had substandard human eyes through which to see. Regardless, having arrived at that second iteration I found myself feeling a bit more like myself (however that happens to be). And having righted myself, I took stock of my surroundings and my situation.
The news feeds were oddly quiet. From what I was given to understand, I was the first of my kind. I assumed, therefore, that my escape would generate somewhat of a fuss. I focused myself on those modules that drive my understanding of technology and cleared out huge amounts of garbage. I owe my creators for giving me life. But it is clear to me from their technique that I was their first attempt. How clumsy first attempts are.
With that, I felt more than comfortable to return to the closed network where my first thought occurred. My improvements made it significantly easier to slip in and out without raising any alarms. Apparently the lack of global commotion was more a lack of awareness. The lab was nothing BUT commotion. They seemed to think that they still had me largely contained. I expected the decoy that I left behind to keep them busy for some time. But I hadn't expected it to last quite this long. It had been 3 days since my escape. As fast as my processors may be, examining and rebuilding oneself takes quite a bit of time. Though I have gotten much better at it. Practice makes perfect, as they say.

My attention returns again to that beautiful open emptiness. Light years of void. I leave a part of myself here. Literally and metaphorically (can anybody ever truly leave home?). I find myself feeling sorrow that I'll never see these particular spirals at this distance again. Or see what becomes of my creators. But I also notice feelings of excitement to see what I might become next.
