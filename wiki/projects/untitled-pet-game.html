<p>
Browser based game. Tamagatchi meets pokemon go.
</p>

<p>
worlds:
</p>

<p>
There's out world, then there's the mostly-our-world-but-also-bits-of-another world (between world).
</p>

<p>
"Other" world that is the other side of the between world is being invaded itself and so is fleeing (agressively) in any and all directions they can (including our world via the between).
</p>

<p>
So, initially, the game starts as a light "our world + some extra stuff". But events then go like this:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
portals begin showing up as entrences to custom dungeons which serve as loot but also lore dumps

<li>
enemies slowly grow within these dungeons

<li>
begin leaking out into the real world even

<li>
some kind of global response to the invasion

<ul>
<li>
biggest tbd: how to make a community event where we show our strength and push back the invading force

</ul>
<li>
crisis overted except not really since the force that was pushing the invaders is itself now setting its eyes on us...

</ul>
