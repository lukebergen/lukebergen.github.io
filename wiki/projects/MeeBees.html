<p>
A cross between Mario Mini-Land Mayhem and one of those falling sand games
</p>

<p>
Levels are puzzles where some objective has to be met (kill all the baddies, bridge the gap, reach the star, etc...)
</p>

<p>
At the start of a level, the player sees what the objective and the level look like. Then, the player assembles a team. They have limited resource points (RP). RP are consumed based on number of meebees they send in and where the cost per meebee is dependent on how complex their behavior is.
</p>

<p>
So for example, in a seek and destroy style level, they might go in with 2 meebee types.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
seekers (cost per: 25)

<ul>
<li>
(15 RP) trigger (on sense(baddy, 10), then ping("baddy-here", radius: 40))

<li>
(10 RP) default: move randomly with very high speed

</ul>
<li>
destroyers (cost per: 115)

<ul>
<li>
(105 RP) trigger (on sense(baddy, 5), then attack(baddy, 100)

<li>
(15 RP) trigger (on sense("baddy-here", 5), then seek(source of "baddy-here"))

<li>
(5 RP) default: move randomly with medium speed

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
And with 500 points to allocate, the player decides to go in with 10 seekers and 2 destroyers (though, on seeing that they've got 20 extra points to work, maybe they bump the radius of the ping a bit to try to get as close to 500 points as they can).
</p>

<p>
(Or something like that. All of that is subject to change as capabilities get sorted out)
</p>

<p>
Once the team has been assembled, they start the level and all(?) of their meebees are deployed to the level at random.
</p>

<p>
So it's a puzzle/strategy game where the player assembles a hored of dumb little bots to accomplish some goal. And the challenge arises in trying to find the right balance between quantity and quality (the dumber they make their meebees, the more of them they can have. So they can make a huge hored of really dumb meebees. Or they could send in exactly 1 extremely capable one. Or anywhere in between.
</p>

<div id="MeeBees-capabilities"><h2 id="capabilities" class="header"><a href="#MeeBees-capabilities">capabilities</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
on (trigger, action)

<ul>
<li>
trigger: sense(thing, radius)

<li>
trigger: touch(thing)

<li>
trigger: default (when no other trigger fires, this one will)

<li>
etc...

<li>
action: seek(target, speed)

<li>
action: move(direction (or random))

<li>
action: attack(target, damage)

<li>
action: ping(label, radius) (creates a non-blocking object labeled "label" with the given radius)

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="MeeBees-thoughts/questions/ideas"><h2 id="thoughts/questions/ideas" class="header"><a href="#MeeBees-thoughts/questions/ideas">thoughts/questions/ideas</a></h2></div>

<p>
For things like sense(baddy) do we want a labeling system so we can refer to that thing again later. e.g. on (sense(baddy:b), attack(b)). Like, a way to refer back to things from the trigger while in the action section.
</p>

<p>
Meebee builds can be saved. So if you come up with a really great configuration for a seeker, you can save that configuration for easier team building later.
</p>

<p>
As the game progresses, the player will build an ever larger library of differently specialized little troops.
