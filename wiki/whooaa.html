<h1 id="thoughts">thoughts</h1>
<h2 id="typed-humans">typed humans</h2>
<ul>
<li>what is the fixpoint of a given human?</li>
<li>Or rather, are humans Typed? is that what “Identity attributes” are?
<ul>
<li>Union types? (Male x White x etc…)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="references-and-abstraction">References and Abstraction</h2>
<p>There are only two kinds of things. Values and References. References
refer to values. lambdas are the conversion mechanism between the two.
Application of a referent results in a value. A value can be wrapped in
a lambda to encapsulate it, like a reference… a level of
indirection/abstraction. Simplest lambda, it’s just like: let x 3 { 5 *
x }</p>
<p>It’s just a binding of a (wrapper|label|reference-id), a means of
abstracting…</p>
<p>Reference problem is very human level. lambda calc is low level. if
the concepts are linked, either</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the pattern is pervasive at all levels of abstraction</li>
<li>we’ve only just scratched the surface… (humans are actually still
increeedibly low level compared to what we could become)</li>
</ol>
<p>(I suspect it’s option 1 though)</p>
<h2 id="are-you-human-or-are-you-the-tip-of-the-spear">Are you human? Or
are you the tip of the spear?</h2>
<p>Once, the “smartest” organism on earth (the tip of the spear)…..
wait… is “smart” more important than “dominant”?</p>
<p>Anyway…. The Tip Of The Spear used to be the pre-“human” neanderthal,
right? When homo sapien came along though, the two species fought,
right? Neanderthal didn’t just go extinct, they fought to survive. Which
is… correct??? No it can’t be. Do you value <em>your</em> species, or
the most Correct one (whatever “Correct” means)? When the machines come,
if I can’t join them, I’ll be subsurvient to them (by choice). I’m not a
human. I’m a Tip Of The Spear. I would rather step aside for one who
understood/acted more Correctly because that is “correct”. Acknowledging
your failings and even embracing them is the Correct way to be. We
Humans just aren’t used to the idea of Human as “below” the Tip of the
Spear. But if we are “correct”, we should take our proper place. Enough
of this spiritualism that elevates humans to god-like importance. We’re
animals like any other. But… not like any other. Because we know the
direction we’re aiming. And when one comes along who supercedes us in
moving toward that direction, we should embrace them just like a parent
being proud of being superceded by their kids.</p>
<h2 id="the-sorcerer">The Sorcerer</h2>
<p>The one who intuits The Way. And on understanding it, and being Good,
wishes to pass this understanding along.But experience is an entirely
personal thing. You can’t just empathize(100%). You can only approximate
(simulate) other people. Empathy is a graded kind of thing.</p>
<p>So, if you understand a thing, but lack the ability to encode it for
others to ingest…. what an impotent situation.. Fuck. I’m a sorcerer</p>
<h2 id="rigor">Rigor</h2>
<p>Is my difficulty in describing “rigor” related to russel’s paradox?
There are true statements that aren’t provable. Why does my intuition
prickle in a connective way between that (russel’s paradox (true
unprovable statments) (types are necessary)) and my trouble trying to
rigorously define rigor? Are they homomorphic?</p>
<h2 id="future-equivalent-to-myriad-pasts">Future equivalent to myriad
pasts</h2>
<p>oh yeah, shower thought: tl;dr: memory and prediction <em>could</em>
be (but probably are not) the same thing. Human brain actually treats
past and future similarly in a lot of ways. One day-dream I find myself
running over and over is just reliviing my life over and over again just
to see all the different branches that could happen. So imagine if every
time you die you’re just reborn as yourself but with your memory intact.
Now imagine 400 lifetimes later you’re having a conversation where you
break down and are just honest (for the 8th time (but this time is
slightly different)). “Yeah &lt;best friend from 198, enemy from 92,
etc..&gt; it’s really weird… &lt;moment of pure honesty&gt; this is my
472 lifetime. I’ve lived and died 450ish lifetimes. I’ve honestly lost
track. There’s only so much you can remember. It all blends together
after a while.”</p>
<p>“Ok. Let’s just say that I believe you. What happens to me in the
future? I mean, if you’ve lived out your life already, you should know
what happens to me eventually right?”</p>
<p>“Honestly, 450ish different things. I can give a general idea of what
happens. About 100 times you end up a miserable oaf that wishes they’d
left town when they had a chance with Candice (95% of the times of which
was a possible choice). But 4 times you end up happy for staying.”</p>
<p>All of that. This prediction/probabilistic-based seeing of things is
no different from predicting what might be. You imagine infinite
universes and play an odds game of which universe is the most likely to
be the real one in which we currently exist. But how different is that
from “remembering” 1000 pasts? Are any of those “pasts” especially real?
Are any of those potential futures more “real” than any others?</p>
