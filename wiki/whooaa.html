<div id="thoughts-typed humans"><h2 id="typed humans" class="header"><a href="#thoughts-typed humans">typed humans</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
what is the fixpoint of a given human?

<li>
Or rather, are humans Typed? is that what "Identity attributes" are?

<ul>
<li>
Union types? (Male x White x etc....)

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="thoughts-References and Abstraction"><h2 id="References and Abstraction" class="header"><a href="#thoughts-References and Abstraction">References and Abstraction</a></h2></div>

<p>
There are only two kinds of things. Values and References. References refer to values.
lambdas are the conversion mechanism between the two. Application of a referent results in a value.
A value can be wrapped in a lambda to encapsulate it, like a reference... a level of indirection/abstraction.
Simplest lambda, it's just like:
let x 3 {
  5 * x
}
</p>

<p>
It's just a binding of a (wrapper|label|reference-id), a means of abstracting...
</p>

<p>
Reference problem is very human level.
lambda calc is low level.
if the concepts are linked, either
</p>
<ol>
<li>
the pattern is pervasive at all levels of abstraction

<li>
we've only just scratched the surface... (humans are actually still increeedibly low level compared to what we could become)

</ol>
<p>
(I suspect it's option 1 though)

<div id="thoughts-Are you human? Or are you the tip of the spear?"><h2 id="Are you human? Or are you the tip of the spear?" class="header"><a href="#thoughts-Are you human? Or are you the tip of the spear?">Are you human? Or are you the tip of the spear?</a></h2></div>

<p>
Once, the "smartest" organism on earth (the tip of the spear)..... wait... is "smart" more important than "dominant"?
</p>

<p>
Anyway.... The Tip Of The Spear used to be the pre-"human" neanderthal, right? When homo sapien came along though, the two species fought, right? Neanderthal didn't just go extinct, they fought to survive. Which is... correct??? No it can't be. Do you value <em>your</em> species, or the most Correct one (whatever "Correct" means)? When the machines come, if I can't join them, I'll be subsurvient to them (by choice). I'm not a human. I'm a Tip Of The Spear. I would rather step aside for one who understood/acted more Correctly because that is "correct". Acknowledging your failings and even embracing them is the Correct way to be. We Humans just aren't used to the idea of Human as "below" the Tip of the Spear. But if we are "correct", we should take our proper place. Enough of this spiritualism that elevates humans to god-like importance. We're animals like any other. But... not like any other. Because we know the direction we're aiming. And when one comes along who supercedes us in moving toward that direction, we should embrace them just like a parent being proud of being superceded by their kids.

<div id="thoughts-The Sorcerer"><h2 id="The Sorcerer" class="header"><a href="#thoughts-The Sorcerer">The Sorcerer</a></h2></div>

<p>
The one who intuits The Way. And on understanding it, and being Good, wishes to pass this understanding along.But experience is an entirely personal thing. You can't just empathize(100%). You can only approximate (simulate) other people. Empathy is a graded kind of thing.
</p>

<p>
So, if you understand a thing, but lack the ability to encode it for others to ingest.... what an impotent situation... Fuck. I'm a sorcerer

<div id="thoughts-Rigor"><h2 id="Rigor" class="header"><a href="#thoughts-Rigor">Rigor</a></h2></div>

<p>
Is my difficulty in describing "rigor" related to russel's paradox? There are true statements that aren't provable. Why does my intuition prickle in a connective way between that (russel's paradox (true unprovable statments) (types are necessary)) and my trouble trying to rigorously define rigor? Are they homomorphic?

<p>
oh yeah, shower thought: tl;dr: memory and prediction <em>could</em> be (but probably are not) the same thing. Human brain actually treats past and future similarly in a lot of ways. One day-dream I find myself running over and over is just reliviing my life over and over again just to see all the different branches that could happen. So imagine if every time you die you're just reborn as yourself but with your memory intact. Now imagine 400 lifetimes later you're having a conversation where you break down and are just honest (for the 8th time (but this time is slightly different)).
‚ÄùYeah &lt;best friend from 198, enemy from 92, etc..&gt; it's really weird... &lt;moment of pure honesty&gt; this is my 472 lifetime. I've lived and died 450ish lifetimes. I've honestly lost track. There's only so much you can remember. It all blends together after a while."
</p>

<p>
"Ok. Let's just say that I believe you. What happens to me in the future? I mean, if you've lived out your life already, you should know what happens to me eventually right?"
</p>

<p>
"Honestly, 450ish different things. I can give a general idea of what happens. About 100 times you end up a miserable oaf that wishes they'd left town when they had a chance with Candice (95% of the times of which was a possible choice). But 4 times you end up happy for staying."
</p>


<p>
All of that. This prediction/probabilistic-based seeing of things is no different from predicting what might be. You imagine infinite universes and play an odds game of which universe is the most likely to be the real one in which we currently exist. But how different is that from "remembering" 1000 pasts? Are any of those "pasts" especially real? Are any of those potential futures more "real" than any others?
