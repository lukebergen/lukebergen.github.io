      <h1>Hi, I'm Luke Bergen</h1>
      <h3>I write code. The public bits of which you can check out on <a href="https://github.com/lukebergen">github</a>.</h3>
      <h3>I'm on social media from time to time at <a href="https://twitter.com/lbergen">@lbergen</a>.</h3>
      <h3>I've worked at various places and made business connections with people which you can read about on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-bergen-4884412">linkedin</a>.
      <h3>Big projects are fun. But I most enjoy random little one-off <a href="things">things</a>.</h3>
      <h3>I'm a fan of coding, reading, video-gaming, philosophy, and the Oxford comma (in that approximate order).</h3>
      <h3>Shoot me an <a href="mailto:lukeabergen@gmail.com">email</a> some time.</h3>
